# Filebeat

Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for **forwarding and centralizing log data**. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events, and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.

Apica Ascent supports data ingestion from Filebeat. The following section describes the steps for configuring log forwarding from Filebeat to Apica Ascent by modifying the Filebeat configuration file.&#x20;

## Configuring Filebeat to forward logs to Apica Ascent

To configure Filebeat, you need to configure the Filebeat configuration file. The location of your Filebeat configuration file can vary depending on your platform. Locate and access the configuration file and modify it as described below.

### Ingest Ports

Apica Ascent hosts the lumberjack protocol at port **25224 (non-TLS)**

The ports are configurable and can be changed if needed.

### Understanding Filebeats configuration

Filebeats configuration consists of 2 key sections _**input**_ and _**output.**_

The input section describes what files to process. The output section describes how/where to send the collected data. In addition, the input section contains _**processors**_ that allow data modification before it is sent to the output. We will look at each of these below.

### INPUT

The input section will typically contain the list of file paths that Filebeat should monitor.

```
inputs:
  - enabled: true
    paths:
    - /var/log/*.log
    type: filestream
```

### OUTPUT

The output section describes how to send data to Apica Ascent. The Apica Ascent layer supports the lumberjack protocols v1 and v2 for ingesting data and is compatible with _logstash_. Use output type _logstash_

```
output:
  logstash:
    hosts:
    - "<Logiq-endpoint>:25224"
    worker: 12
    bulk_max_size: 25
    ttl: 5s
```

### PROCESSORS

Under the `input` section, including the `processors` the section in addition to your existing Filebeat configuration along with **`namespace`**, **`application`**, and **`cluster_id`**. Doing so ensures that the logs you forward to Apica Ascent can be identified and partitioned easily

We strongly recommend partitioning your data for better organization as well as query performance. Each Cluster, Namespace, and Application tuple becomes a partition in Apica Ascent and can be used to organize data that is logically related

```
  inputs:
  - enabled: true
    paths:
    - <path to your log>
    type: filestream
    processors:
      - add_fields:
          target: logiq
          fields:
            namespace: myproject
            application: test
            cluster_id: foo
```

### PERSISTENCE

We strongly recommend running fiilebeats with disk persistence enabled. Not doing so can result in data loss when there are mismatches in throughput, sudden data bursts etc.



```
queue:
  disk:
    max_size: 1GB
    path: <path to your diskqueue e.g. ./diskqueue>
```

Please note the diskqueue folder must exist and have write permissions for filebeats

### Example&#x20;

The following is a complete _Filebeat_ configuration for forwarding logs to Apica Ascent without SSL.&#x20;

```
filebeat:
  inputs:
  - enabled: true
    paths:
    - <path to your log>
    type: filestream
    processors:
      - add_fields:
          target: logiq
          fields:
            namespace: myproject
            application: test
            cluster_id: foo

output:
#  console:
#   pretty: true
  logstash:
    hosts:
    - "<Logiq-endpoint>:25224"
processors:
- add_host_metadata:
    when:
      not:
        contains:
          tags: forwarded
- add_cloud_metadata: null
- add_docker_metadata: null
- add_kubernetes_metadata: null
setup:
  kibana: null
  template:
    settings:
      index:
        number_of_shards: 1
```
