# Share Search Results

Apica Ascent's built-in search engine makes the search queries you build and run in Apica Ascent and their search results instantly shareable. You can share searches via a generated URL that enables your search queries to be reusable within the queried namespace/applications. It also allows other teams who don't have access to your Apica Ascent instance to view search results.

Once you share a search result, Apica Ascent stores the search keywords, query, namespace, applications, time range, and the search results themselves for 30 days.

## Share a Search

To share a search result, do the following:

1. Once you've created a search worth saving and sharing, click the **Share search results** icon in the toolbar.
2. **Name** your search.
3. Toggle the **Share** button to generate a shareable URL.
4. Copy and store the generated URL for future use.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (99) (1).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (54) (1).png>)

You can now share this URL in any way you please. Those who access this URL will be able to view and sort through the search results you shared.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** URLs generated for sharing search results will expire after 30 days.
{% endhint %}

### Accessing Shared Searches

Apica Ascent saves shared searches for quick access in the search bar under **Favorites**. You can access **Favorites** by clicking the **Show Favorites** button in the search bar.
