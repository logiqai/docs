# Explore Logs

The Explore page lists all the log streams generated across your IT environment that are being ingested into Apica Ascent. The Explore page lists and categorizes logs based on Namespace, Application, ProcID, and when they were last updated. By default, logs are listed by the time they were ingested with the most recent applications appearing on the top. You can filter log streams by namespaces, applications, and ProcIDs. You can also filter them by custom time ranges.

You can also click into a specific application or ProcID to view logs in more detail and to search through or identify patterns within your log data.

## Search Tab

Clicking on the Application link opens the search tab with the most recent logs for the selected log stream. The Search tab presents an infinite view of application logs. The tab is loaded with the most recent logs first, the user can scroll to see older logs. Various filters on the left side of messages help to filter the logs.

On the Search Tab, you can:

* Access log lines in the selected namespace that matches your search pattern.
* Make use of advanced search expressions to build complex queries
* Filter the search results using Facets
* Get field-level details about the entries that match your search

### Filter data

Use facets to narrow your search results. Apica Ascent's intelligent parsing engine extracts facets at the time of data ingestion. Facets are available on the left side of search results. Select a facet and click on the "apply" button to fetch more results. Filtered results will be displayed in a separate tab.
