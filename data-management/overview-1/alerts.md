# Alerts

Users can set up alerts on their queries to receive notifications when specific thresholds or conditions are met. Alerts serve as proactive mechanisms to inform users of critical events or deviations in the data, enabling them to promptly address any issues or take necessary actions.

### **Steps to Set Up an Alert**

1. **Open Alert Modal:**
   * Click on the "More" icon on the widget.
   * From the dropdown menu, select "Add Alert" to open the alert configuration modal.
2. **Configure Your Alert:**
   * Fill in the necessary details to define your alert conditions and thresholds.
3. **Create Alert:**
   * Once you have configured the alert, click on the "Create Alert" button to save it.

### **Viewing Alerts**

Once alerts are created, navigate to the "Alerts" tab to view and manage existing alerts. If the "Alerts" tab is not present, you may need to add a new tab and select "Alerts" as the tab type.

_Note:_ The alerts listed under the "Alerts" tab are specific to the current dashboard you are viewing. This means they are tailored to the metrics and data associated with that particular dashboard.
