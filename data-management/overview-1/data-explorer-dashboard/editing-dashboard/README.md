# Editing Dashboard

### Edit Mode Features

Edit mode in our dashboard allows users to personalize and enhance their workspace by offering several key functionalities:

* **Resize Widgets**: Users can adjust the dimensions of widgets to better fit their display area and prioritize the visibility of certain data sets. This flexibility ensures that all information is presented clearly and concisely.
* **Change Widget Positions**: Easily drag and drop widgets to rearrange them according to preference. By rearranging widgets, users can create a more intuitive layout that aligns with their workflow, thus optimizing accessibility and productivity.
* **Delete Widgets**: If certain widgets are no longer needed, users can remove them to declutter their dashboard and focus on the most relevant information. This helps in maintaining a clean and streamlined workspace.
* **Move Widgets Between Tabs**: For better organization, users can move widgets from one tab to another. This feature is particularly useful for grouping related data together or separating them based on different projects or priorities.
* **Add Filters**: Enhance data analysis by applying filters to the dashboard, allowing for a more targeted review of information. Filters enable users to drill down into specific segments of data and extract valuable insights with ease.

These features collectively provide users with the capability to fully configure and customize their dashboards, ensuring that the environment adapts to individual preferences and operational needs.
