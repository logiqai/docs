# Data Explorer Dashboard

The **DataExplorer Dashboard Tool** is designed to offer robust functionalities for monitoring your applications and infrastructure. This tool provides an extensive range of features that allow users to edit their data comprehensively and configure various widgets to display critical information effectively. Users can organize these widgets systematically by segregating them into different tabs. Each tab can group several related queries, providing an intuitive way to categorize and access data specific to certain aspects of your applications or infrastructure.

Additionally, the tool empowers users with the capability to customize the dashboard based on its header. This feature is particularly useful as it enables users to filter the displayed data based on specific parameters they select. By filtering data, users can tailor the information to their needs, making the dashboard more relevant and insightful for their specific use cases. This filtering capability also aids in configuring the widgets more precisely, ensuring that the dashboard remains a powerful tool in the hands of its users by providing clarity and focus on the data that matters most.

Moreover, users have the option to add alerts directly into the widgets. This functionality is enhanced by the ability to include an alert tab within the dashboard. The alert tab serves as a central location displaying all configured alerts, allowing for seamless monitoring and prompt action on issues relevant to the specific dashboard. This enhanced alert system ensures that users can stay informed about critical events and thresholds, maintaining operational oversight at all times.
