**LOGIQ** Supports **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus** data source which is a Prometheus-compatible monitoring and alerting service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications and infrastructure at scale.

With Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the open-source Prometheus query language (**PromQL**) to monitor and alert on the performance of containerized workloads, without having to scale and operate the underlying infrastructure.

The service is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
