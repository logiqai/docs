## User Story Enhancements <a href="#user-story-enhancements" id="user-story-enhancements"></a>

* Added a new supported Selenium IDE command, [setLocation](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2135393876/Comparing+Selenium+IDE+Scripts+to+ASM+Scenarios#setLocation)
* Added missing attributes to the response bodies of the [/users](https://api-asm1.apica.io/v3/Help/Route/GET-users) and [/users/{user\_guid}](https://api-asm1.apica.io/v3/Help/Route/GET-users-user\_guid) API GET request endpoints

## Bug Fixes <a href="#bug-fixes" id="bug-fixes"></a>

* Fixed an issue in which checks were not correctly saved when an incorrect inclusion/exclusion period was used and the user was not notified of a reason. After the fix, users will be notified explicitly if their inclusion/exclusion period is incorrect.
* Fixed an issue which prevented custom DNS from being used on the latest infrastructure
* Fixed an issue which prevented an error message from being generated and displayed in the event that auto refresh fails to refresh a Dashboard.
* Fixed an issue which prevented [Power Users](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2133760724) who had limited editing permissions from saving checks. For instance, Power Users who could edit only the name, description, and tags of a check could not save the check after doing so. The bug fix resolved this issue.
* Fixed the following API call: [https://api-wpm.apicasystem.com/v3/Help/Route/GET-checks-proxysniffer-checkId-results-resultId-errorlog](https://api-wpm.apicasystem.com/v3/Help/Route/GET-checks-proxysniffer-checkId-results-resultId-errorlog) which was returning a 500 server error previously.
* Fixed an issue with certain checks which prevented Request & Response Headers from showing correctly within the Check Details page:

* Fixed an issue which prevented API calls from returning correct responses when a new user’s time zone was not set
* Fixed an issue which prevented spaces in between the “accepted codes” field for a URLv2 check:

* Updated API documentation for URL, URLv2 checks to include acceptable "secureProtocolVersion" values
* Fixed an issue with Ad Hoc report generation for certain users
* Fixed issues which prevented Command checks from being created or fetched via the ASM API.
