# Ascent 2.11.0

### **Platform-Wide Highlight: Casdoor Integration**

This release introduces full integration with **Casdoor**, our new authentication and authorization system -  a foundational upgrade to Apica’s identity and access management model.

#### Key Benefits:

* **Centralized Login & Session Management**: Secure, unified authentication across all modules.
* **Fine-Grained Policy Enforcement**: Access control enforced at the resource level for dashboards, alerts, plugins, and more.
* **Enhanced Security**:
  * Secure, HTTP-only cookies
  * Configurable idle timeouts (default 20 mins)
  * Rate-limiting and account lockout after failed logins
  * Restriction on concurrent sessions
* **Future-Ready**: Lays the groundwork for modern authentication methods including OAuth and biometric logins like Face ID and for advanced features such as user impersonation and compliance-driven access control.
* **Role and Policy Sync with Casdoor**\
  When you delete a role in Ascent, all related user-role and policy mappings are now also removed from Casdoor, keeping your identity platform and Ascent in sync.
