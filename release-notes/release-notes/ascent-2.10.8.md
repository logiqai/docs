# Ascent 2.10.8

### Fixes and Improvements

This release focuses on improving reliability and consistency in Pipeline and Check Analytics behavior. The following issues have been resolved:

***

#### Pipeline & Data Flow Fixes

* **Missing Pipeline Visibility**\
  Resolved issue where a second pipeline intermittently disappeared from the Pipeline view, even though it was applied to the namespace. Both pipelines now appear correctly.
* **Pipeline Preview Fails**\
  Fixed a problem where the pipeline preview in Logs & Insights failed to display results, even when valid data existed.
* **Deleted Rules Still Visible**\
  Addressed a bug where deleted pipeline rules continued to appear in the UI, marked in red. These are now correctly removed from the view once deleted.

***

#### Synthetics / Check Analytics Fixes

* **Incorrect Fatal Check Messages**\
  Corrected misleading error messages shown in Ascent for failed synthetic checks. The system now shows accurate messages, in line with ASM.
* **Monitor Group User Assignment Bug**\
  Fixed an issue where assigning or un-assigning users to/from a monitor group appeared to have “no changes to apply,” even when actions were taken. User assignments now save and reflect correctly.
