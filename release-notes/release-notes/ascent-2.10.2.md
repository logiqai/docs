# Ascent 2.10.2

### ASM 13.34.0

**Browser Behavior Improvements**:

* We've resolved an issue where, after upgrading to Chrome 130, some users were experiencing a different behavior. Specifically, the client was triggering the mobile/collapsed version of the web application instead of the desktop version, which was causing Selenium scenarios to fail. This has been corrected to ensure a consistent experience.
* We've also fixed a problem where certain requests were incorrectly reported as URL errors in Chrome 130. Previously, these requests were reported as "cancelled" without throwing an error in Chrome 115. This update ensures more accurate error reporting.
* These changes should provide a smoother and more reliable experience with ASM.

### Flow

## Pipelines (New)

#### Pipeline Dashboard & Navigation

* **New Pipeline Dashboard**: We've designed the Pipeline dashboard with intuitive summary cards showing total pipelines, data flows, and pipeline rules at a glance.
* **Enhanced List View**: Pipeline lists include actionable information with good filtering options:
  * Search by pipeline name, rule type, namespace, application, and state
  * Visual identification of rule types with color-coded icons for each rule category
  * Quick access to pipeline metrics directly in the list view
* **Improved Navigation**:
  * Pipeline names are clickable, opening a dashboard with preselected pipeline
  * Dataflow entries are clickable, opening a dashboard with preselected pipeline, namespace, and application to quickly view metrics and graphical data
  * Action buttons are accessible with clearer visual indicators

#### Pipeline Configuration

* **Grouped Graph View**: We've replaced the previous pipeline graph visualization with a clearer grouped pipeline view having multiple rules inside of it for better understanding of your data flows.
* **Easier Pipeline Creation**: You can now create new pipelines and attach them to your currently selected namespace:application (dataflow) right from the pipeline view.
* **Rules Management**:
  * Rules are now brought directly to the pipeline page for easier access
  * Pipelines are decoupled from forwarders. Configure Pipeline modal no longer shows 'Forward Rule' when adding new rules.
  * 'Enable Code' switch is enabled by default
* **Preview Improvements**:
  * Added GenAI option for generating sample logs in configure pipeline page.
  * Loading indicators when fetching sample logs, namespaces, or applications.
  * Better handling of empty dropdowns and state management
  * Replaced dataflow dropdown with direct namespace/application selection for clarity

#### Rules Enhancements

#### New and Improved Rules

* **Stream Rule**: This powerful rule helps you redirect the data flows to other stream for better data management.
* **Forward Rule Enhancements**:
  * Support for multiple attribute renaming with regex patterns in forward rule creation.
  * Enhanced preview functionality to properly display changed logs affected by rules.

#### Rule Management Interface

* **Refactored Rule Interface**: We've completely rebuilt our rule creation and editing interface:

  * Separated code blocks into their own tab for cleaner organization
  * Improved form fields with better validation
* **Event Suppression**: Added UI support for suppressing duplicate events (deduplication) within filter rules, allowing you to:
  * Set suppression duration periods
  * See aggregated events when the suppression period ends
* **Visual Rule Identification**: Each rule type now has distinctive icons in the pipeline view for quick visual recognition.

#### Performance and Stability

#### Metrics and Monitoring

* **Enhanced Pipeline Metrics**: Added detailed metrics to help you track:
  * Pipeline execution time by pipeline ID/name, namespace, and application
  * Logs dropped in each pipeline
  * Number of new events created in new streams

#### System Improvements

* **Cache Management**: Pipeline cache now updates automatically on pipeline configuration changes.
* **Rule Processing**: Rule type workers now operate at the channel level instead of globally, improving processing efficiency.

#### Terminology Updates

* **'Events' to 'Journals'**: We've updated our terminology from "events" to "journals" throughout the interface for better clarity.
