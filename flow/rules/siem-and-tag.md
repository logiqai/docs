# SIEM and TAG

SIEM and TAG rules are Log2Metric rules that can be used to tag data for any interesting events. Apica Ascent Log2Metrics is a powerful feature that helps you convert your log data into a real-time metric. Using Log2Metrics, you can visualize your log data, plot distributions, create a custom index, and create alerts for events.

This is useful for identifying the interesting events that may occur in logs in real-time. For example track, user login failures, track load balancer or ingress status codes, etc... See the section about [Log2Metrics](../../log-management/metrics-and-custom-indices.md) for additional information.

Apica Ascent has hundreds of inbuilt SIEM rules which can be accessed on the "Explore -> Pipeline -> Rules" tab .
