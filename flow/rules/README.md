# Rules

Apica Ascent provides a set of Data Management Rules that help you manage your data. These rules are packaged into Rule Packs and are available on the Pipelines page.

It is easy to write custom rules in the system to accomplish a variety of data transformation tasks such as filtering, dropping data, changing attribute names, assembing data frames for forwarding among others.&#x20;

Here are some of the Data Management Rules that Apica Ascent supports:

* [Filter Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/filter)
* [Extract Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/extract)
* [SIEM Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/siem-and-tag)
* [TAG Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/siem-and-tag)
* [Rewrite Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/rewrite)
* [Code Rules](https://docs.apica.io/data-management/code)
* [Forward Rules](https://docs.logiq.ai/data-management/forward)
