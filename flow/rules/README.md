To modify a rule, use the ellipsis button available on each rule to access the available actions. To deactivate a rule, simply uncheck the checkbox associated with the rule.

You can test code updates directly within the app with the preview button. Simply provide a code snippet to update the log object, and instantly visualize the differences with our intuitive JSON compare view. Highlighted lines indicate changes, making it easy to review modifications at a glance. This feature not only streamlines the testing process but also empowers you to confidently manage updates to your log object.
