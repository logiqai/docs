# OpenTelemetry Logs / Traces

Open telemetry logs and traces are supported in the telemetry pipeline. You can use the standard otel logs and traces endpoints in ascent to ingest data. More details on the OpenTelemetry collector configuration to send logs in OTLP format can be found in integration [here](../../integrations/list-of-integrations/opentelemetry.md).
