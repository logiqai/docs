* Expand the `Create` menu from the navigation bar and click `Forwarder`
* Select the `Arc Sight` based on the type of format you want to use
* Click `New Forwarder` button at the top right corner
* Provide the host of the Arc Sight and the name of the forwarder

Once the forwarder is associated with a specific namespace/application or with various log attributes, the logs that match these criteria will be sent to ArcSight for further analysis.
