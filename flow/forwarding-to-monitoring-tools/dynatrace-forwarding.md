# Dynatrace Forwarding

To Generate an API Key from Dynatrace, please follow the instructions in this [link](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/basics/dynatrace-api-authentication).

NOTE: Make sure to add the "logs.ingest" scope during token creation.

### Steps to Create Dynatrace Forwarding <a href="#steps-to-create-new-relic-forwarding" id="steps-to-create-new-relic-forwarding"></a>

To forward your logs to Dynatrace, begin by logging into Apica's website.

* Navigate to the **`Integrations`**&#x74;ab, select the option for **`Forwarders`**, and then **`Add Forwarder`**
* Next, choose **`Dynatrace(HTTP event collector)`** from the available options; this will bring up a new form with fields such as `API Key`, `Host`, `Tags`, etc. Fill out the required data in these fields and click **`Create`**.

Create Forwarder:

Copy

```
Api_Key:       <DYNATRACE-API-KEY>
Host:          <{DYNATRACE_ENV_ID}.live.dynatrace.com>
Tags:          logflow
Type:          _json
Name:          Dynatrace
```

* Next, head over to the **`Explore`** page and pick out a namespace you wish to forward your logs to Dynatrace.
* Click on the three dots icon located next to the calendar and opt for **`Map Forwarder`**; this will open a new modal that allows you to choose the newly created Dynatrace forwarder schema (this can be identified via its Dynatrace icon).
* Confirm your selection by clicking **`OK`**.
* A successful mapping is indicated by a popup showing that namespace-application pairs are connected with respective forwarders; additionally, you'll notice an updated Namespace Forwarder status in effect.
* Your logs are now being forwarded to Dynatrace.
