# Advance Search

The Advance Search feature allows users to create complex search queries to refine their search results. This functionality is accessible via a modal interface that provides options to use logical operators such as AND, OR, and grouping for advanced query building. Within the modal, there are three buttons: one to Search, which executes the query; another to Save, allowing users to store their queries for later use; and a Cancel button, which closes the modal without making any changes.

The Advance Search feature not only allows users to create complex queries but also provides the functionality to save these queries for later use. Users can access their saved queries directly from the input field in the Advance Search modal. This feature enhances user efficiency by enabling quick access to frequently used search configurations.
