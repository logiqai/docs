# Overview

Fleet is the ultimate solution for making the collection of observability data responsive to changes in your environment using your pre-existing observability agents.

With Fleet, you can collect more data when you need it and less when you donâ€™t. And the best part? Almost all observability agents can be managed through configuration files describing how to collect, enrich and send data.&#x20;

Fleet aims to simplify this process through an agent manager. The Fleet Agent Manager functions as a sidecar utility that checks for new configuration files and triggers the appropriate restart/reload functionality of the supported agent. The Agent Manager is kept intentionally simple, with the goal that it only needs to be installed once and updated infrequently.&#x20;

Navigate **Explore > Fleet** will show the agent list that are configured and managed by the fleet.

**Supported Agent Types:**

The fleet platform comes with many agent types already set up, the ability to add custom agent types, and assign configurations to them all from the intuitive fleet UI.&#x20;

**Fleet Agent Status Metric:**

There is a new status metric, available in Apica Ascent, to track the status of Fleet agents which can be accessed by the name "logiq\_agent\_liveness" from the query page.&#x20;

Following is the meaning of each status:&#x20;

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="119" align="center">Sl. No.</th><th width="344" align="center">Agent Status</th><th align="center">Metric Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1.</td><td align="center">Active, Running, Maintenance</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2.</td><td align="center">Disconnected</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3.</td><td align="center">Inactive, Stopped, Stopping</td><td align="center">-1</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4.</td><td align="center">Error</td><td align="center">2</td></tr></tbody></table>
