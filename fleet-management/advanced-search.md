# Advanced Search

The Advanced Search feature allows users to create complex search queries to refine their search results. This functionality is accessible by clicking the filter icon in the search box. It provides options to use logical operators such as AND, OR, and grouping for advanced query building.

The Advanced Search feature not only allows users to create complex queries but also provides the functionality to save these queries for later use. Users can access their saved queries directly from the input field in the Advanced Search dialog box.
