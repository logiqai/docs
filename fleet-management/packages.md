# Packages

Fleet also makes it easy to manage agent packages. Packages can be full agent installation packages, or agent add-on functionality packages.

Agent packages available through Fleet are configured within the Fleet Repository. Any packages available for assignment to agents can be seen using the Fleet UI.
