Fleet makes it easy to manage your agent configurations all in one place. With Fleet, you can import or create configuration files for your agents using the intuitive UI.

You can also manage configurations using a git repository, and Fleet can import all of your configurations from that repository. Updating configurations and deploying them to assigned agents can be as simple as a git push.

**Configurations:**

Users can filter the contents of the Configurations tab by name and agent types.

Select any configuration to view its content or update them. To delete a configuration, choose Actions and select the Delete option.&#x20;
