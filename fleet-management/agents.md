With Fleet, you can effectively track and manage large collections of telemetry collection agents across your observability systems. See up-to-date status information about all agents. Apply updates to agent configurations, or install new agents, or upgrade existing ones.

**Agents List:**

This shows agents registered with Fleet. Filter the agents by name, host name, version and agent type. The Actions menu allows actions to be performed on selected agents. Actions include starting, stopping, restarting, or deleting agents.
