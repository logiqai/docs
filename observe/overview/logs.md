# Logs

All the Logs contained in the Span are indexed automatically along with the rest of the log data managed by Apica Ascent. The log data can now be fully searched for spans, traces, and logs. The user also has the option of going from the Traces view to Analyze and gather all trace logs or from the Logs View to a Trace that generated the log. This makes root cause easy and convenient.
