# Ascent AI Agent Monitoring

## Ascent AI & LLM Observability Deployment Model

The guide will enable monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing the performance, cost, security, and quality of your AI-driven applications. Unlike traditional observability, which focuses on infrastructure and application performance, AI observability with Ascent extends to:

* Model Performance – Tracking inference latency, response times, and failure rates.
* Full Workflow Tracing – Understanding how data flows through AI pipelines using distributed tracing.
* Cost & Resource Efficiency – Optimizing GPU/CPU usage, API call expenses, and token consumption.
* Security & Compliance – Detecting data leakage, unauthorized access, and enforcing privacy policies.
* Response Quality – Evaluating model accuracy, bias, hallucinations, and user engagement.

With AI models becoming core to modern applications, observability ensures reliability, efficiency, and trust in AI-driven decision-making.

### Key use cases for AI and LLM Observability

The primary Ascent use cases for AI and LLM observability include the following:

1\.    **Service Health & Performance Monitoring** – Similar to traditional APM solutions but tailored for AI workloads, ensuring model inference times and API performance are stable.

2\.    **Full Application Workflow Tracing** – Distributed tracing helps identify bottlenecks across AI pipelines, which is crucial for debugging complex LLM applications.

3\.    **LLM Stack Cost Analysis** – A key differentiator, focusing on managing compute, API, and infrastructure costs related to AI workloads.

4\.    **Safeguarding LLM and User Data** – Likely involves monitoring data leakage, security policies, and compliance.

5\.    **AI Response Quality** – A major area of concern in AI observability, ensuring that model responses are accurate, relevant, and unbiased.

### Key metrics

Metrics for each of Apica Ascent’s AI & LLM Observability use cases are as follows:

**1. Service Health & Performance Monitoring** - Ensuring AI services are running efficiently and reliably.\
Key Metrics:

* Latency (P50, P90, P99 response times)
* Throughput (Requests per second)
* Error Rates (HTTP 4xx/5xx, model failures)
* Infrastructure Utilization (CPU, GPU, memory usage)
* Model Load & Inference Time

**2. Full Application Workflow Tracing (via Distributed Tracing)** - Tracing LLM interactions across different system components.\
Key Metrics:

* Trace Duration (End-to-end execution time)
* Span Latencies (Delays in different parts of the pipeline)
* Dependency Health (Performance of databases, APIs, vector stores)
* Failure Points (Where requests drop in the workflow)
* Token Flow Analysis (How tokens are processed across requests)

**3. LLM Stack Cost Analysis** - Optimizing costs for model inference and resource consumption.\
Key Metrics:

* Compute Costs (GPU/CPU usage per request)
* API Call Costs (Cost per token for third-party LLMs)
* Memory Utilization Efficiency
* Cost Per Query (Total cost per processed request)
* Idle vs. Active Compute Utilization

**4. Safeguarding LLM and User Data** - Ensuring compliance, security, and privacy.\
Key Metrics:

* Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection Rate
* Unauthorized Access Attempts
* Data Leakage Incidents
* Compliance Adherence (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
* Input/Output Sanitization Effectiveness

**5. AI Response Quality** - Evaluating the accuracy, relevance, and fairness of AI-generated responses.\
Key Metrics:

* Response Accuracy (Ground Truth Comparison)
* Toxicity Score (Bias/Fairness Evaluation)
* Response Consistency (Same input = Same output?)
* Hallucination Rate (Fact-checking %)
* User Engagement & Satisfaction Scores

Each of these aligns well with AI and LLM observability trends.
