# Deploying Apica Ascent PaaS on AWS

## Overview

Apica Ascent can be deployed on AWS in a single AMI instance in a 1-Click fashion using our CloudFormation template and the Apica Ascent AMI from the Amazon Marketplace. Please read and agree [EULA](https://docs.logiq.ai/eula/eula) before proceeding.

All the resources required to create and configure Apica Ascent on AWS are taken care by the template. All you need to do is provide a few simple input parameters.

The CloudFormation template can be found in the software subscription at the AWS marketplace

```
https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083ZMYQNV
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that using the Marketplace AMI is not free and you will be charged per the marketplace published rates for Apica Ascent
{% endhint %}

## Apica Ascent UI credentials <a href="#default-user-and-password" id="default-user-and-password"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
After the Cloud formation template is complete, it may take several minutes for the UI to be available on the AMI.&#x20;

The deployment exposes the UI on an http port by default. You can install an ELB to front the UI via https. This is the recommended production setup.
{% endhint %}

Once the Apica Ascent instance is created, you can login to the instance using the below credentials

**user**: _logiq@foo.com_

**password**: _\<name of your CloudFormation stack>-\<name of your S3 bucket>_

e.g. if CloudFormation stack is called Foo and bucket is called Bar the password is Foo-Bar
