# Alerting on RTO Metrics

Out of the box, we provide 15 pre-configured alerts:

You are off and running once an alert destination is set up and attached to the alert. We integrate with most ITSM providers and have custom webhooks for the ones we don't. To configure an alert destination, navigate to **Integrations -> Alert Destinations -> New Alert Destination (Top Right) -> and fill the appropriate fields out:**

Once the destination is configured you simply add it to the alert:

The alerts we provide cover most, if not all of your bases, but if you wanted to configure an alert on another metric or log it's simple enough. Navigate to your RTO dashboard, click the three dots on the widget you'd like to be alerted on:

Fill out the fields below with your criteria. \

**Best Practice:** Apica recommends clicking the "+" so you can set two values: a lower threshold that throws a warning and a higher threshold that throws critical or emergency. This sets your team up for a proactive monitoring approach.\
