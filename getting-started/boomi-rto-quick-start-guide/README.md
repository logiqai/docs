# Boomi RTO Quick Start Guide

Apicaâ€™s **Run-Time Observability (RTO)** solution provides comprehensive monitoring for **Boomi Atoms, Molecules, and processes,** enabling engineers to monitor, manage, and optimize the performance of their Boomi environments. RTO aggregates key performance metrics, logs, and traces to give full visibility into the health and operation of Boomi runtimes, ensuring seamless integration processes and proactive issue resolution.



### Key Benefits

* **Complete Visibility**\
  Monitor critical system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) and application performance (Boomi APM, Java APM) for comprehensive oversight of Boomi environments.
* **Improved Troubleshooting**\
  By correlating logs, metrics, and traces, RTO makes diagnosing performance issues and root causes easier Boomi Atoms, Molecules, and Clouds. Engineers can quickly pinpoint areas of concern and address them with minimal downtime.
* **Process monitoring**\
  RTO allows engineers to track the performance and execution status of Boomi integrations in real time, providing visibility into each stage of the process. This ensures that any delays, failures, or resource issues within the integration pipeline can be identified and addressed proactively.&#x20;

### Core Features

#### 1. **Comprehensive Runtime Insights**

Track key performance metrics across Boomi Atoms, Molecules, and Clouds, including system resource usage and Boomi-specific metrics such as process execution time, execution count, and Atom worker activity.

#### 2. **Log Management & Analytics**

Capture and analyze logs from Atom workers, web servers, and containers, enabling quick issue identification and efficient troubleshooting.

#### 3. **Custom Dashboards**

Pre-built customizable dashboards to visualize critical performance metrics, helping engineers prioritize and resolve issues quickly.

#### 4. Pre-Configured Alerts

Monitor critical Boomi metrics such as CPU utilization, process failures, and JVM health, notifying engineers of potential issues in real time. These alerts help ensure quick issue resolution, minimize downtime, and maintain optimal performance across Boomi environments.
