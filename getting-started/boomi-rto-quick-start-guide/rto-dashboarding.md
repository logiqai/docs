# RTO Dashboarding

With our RTO solution we want everything to be simple, straight-forward, and easy to use. With this in mind, we created this pre-built dashboard, which has everything you'll need to monitor your Boomi Infrastructure in one spot.&#x20;

As you can see in the high-lighted box, we have all your infrastructure tabs, such as Compute, Storage, Memory, and Network. In addition to this we have included JVM and Atom-specific metrics, which is integral to monitoring your Boomi integrations. \

**We have all your alerts and logs in the same dashboard for convenience:**

This allows for easy correlation between logs and machine performance, leading to faster root cause.
