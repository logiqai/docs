# OpenTelemetry Overview

### What is OpenTelemetry (OTEL)?

OpenTelemetry (OTEL) is an open-source observability framework that provides a standardized approach to collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data—including traces, metrics, and logs—from applications and infrastructure. It is a vendor-neutral solution designed to help organizations gain deep insights into the performance, health, and behavior of their distributed systems without being locked into proprietary observability tools.

By unifying telemetry collection across different platforms, programming languages, and monitoring solutions, OpenTelemetry simplifies instrumentation, reduces integration complexities, and enhances observability capabilities for modern cloud-native applications.

### Definition and Purpose <a href="#toc189582862" id="toc189582862"></a>

At its core, OpenTelemetry serves the following primary purposes:

1. Standardization of Observability Data – OTEL defines a common set of APIs, libraries, and protocols for collecting and transmitting telemetry data, ensuring that observability data is structured and consistent across different environments.
2. Vendor-Neutral Telemetry Collection – Unlike proprietary solutions, OpenTelemetry is not tied to a single vendor, giving users the flexibility to export data to multiple observability platforms, including Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, Elasticsearch, and various commercial solutions.
3. Comprehensive Observability for Distributed Systems – OTEL helps organizations monitor, trace, and analyze applications running in microservices architectures, Kubernetes clusters, serverless environments, and hybrid cloud infrastructures.
4. Simplified Instrumentation – Developers can use OpenTelemetry’s SDKs and automatic instrumentation to collect telemetry data without manually modifying large portions of their application code.
5. Better Troubleshooting and Performance Optimization – By correlating traces, metrics, and logs, OTEL enables teams to detect bottlenecks, troubleshoot incidents faster, and optimize system performance proactively.

### Brief History and CNCF Involvement <a href="#toc189582863" id="toc189582863"></a>

OpenTelemetry originated as a merger of two popular open-source observability projects:

* _**OpenTracing**_ – Focused on distributed tracing instrumentation.
* _**OpenCensus**_ – Provided metrics collection and tracing capabilities.

Recognizing the need for a unified observability framework, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) merged OpenTracing and OpenCensus into OpenTelemetry in 2019, creating a single, industry-wide standard for telemetry data collection.

#### Key Milestones in Open Telemetry’s Evolution: <a href="#hdtk69fg7gbk" id="hdtk69fg7gbk"></a>

* **2016** – OpenTracing & OpenCensus emerge as separate projects to address distributed tracing and metrics collection.
* **2019** – CNCF consolidates both projects into OpenTelemetry to create a single, unified standard.
* **2021** – OpenTelemetry tracing reaches stable release, making it production-ready.
* **2022** – OpenTelemetry metrics reach general availability (GA), expanding beyond tracing.
* **2023**-Present – Work continues on log correlation, profiling, and deeper integrations with various observability platforms.

#### CNCF’s Role in OpenTelemetry <a href="#id-2ex7iy7wzwb" id="id-2ex7iy7wzwb"></a>

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a part of the Linux Foundation, serves as the governing body for OpenTelemetry. CNCF provides:

* Project oversight and funding to support OpenTelemetry’s development.
* Community-driven governance, ensuring OTEL remains an open and collaborative initiative.

Integration with other CNCF projects, such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, Fluentd, and Jaeger, to enhance observability capabilities for cloud-native workloads.

#### Why CNCF Backing Matters <a href="#xvp0t389r7q7" id="xvp0t389r7q7"></a>

CNCF’s involvement ensures OpenTelemetry remains a widely adopted, industry-backed, and continuously evolving framework. With support from major cloud providers (Google, Microsoft, AWS), observability vendors (Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace), and enterprise technology companies, OpenTelemetry has become the de facto standard for open-source observability.

By adopting OpenTelemetry, organizations align with a future-proof, community-driven observability strategy, ensuring compatibility across cloud environments and monitoring solutions.
