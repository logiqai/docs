# Traces

LOGIQ.AI ingests traces and logs from OpenTelemetry collector and Jaeger agent. It implements scalable streaming and indexing of spans, traces and logs directly to any object storage. Users can **search** and **visualize** **spans**, **traces**, and **logs** using a simple intuitive **built-in UI**. Our UI borrows several key aspects from the Jaeger UI project while integrating it seamlessly with LOGIQ.AI's infinitely scalable InstaStore backend built on top of object storage.

### Finding Traces

In the LOGIQ.AI UI, navigate to _Traces_ under _Explore_ in the navigational menu.

You can now search for traces by _Service_ and _Operation_ name as well as _tags_
