### Changes in 0.23.7[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0237) <a href="#changes-in-0237" id="changes-in-0237"></a>

2023-06-15

* Cleaning rollup-suppressed metrics will now happen asynchronously in a jobq, preventing this operation from blocking the delete queue.
* Cleaning rollup-suppressed metrics will now auto-delete metrics that are old enough - not just metrics that are older than the shard being deleted.
* Reduce lock contention on lock `all_surrogates_lock` at crossroads of indexing and ingestion.
* Perform ordered interval list compactions off-heap, reducing memory usage.
* Perform surrogate compactions off-heap, reducing memory usage.
* Use memory map files to perform level index compactions, reducing memory usage.
* Fix issue where raw shard could be erroneously deleted.
* Fix bug where a set of metric indexes were regenerated during a full reconstitute.
* Avoid contention on all-surrogates lock inside indexes.
* Respect `X-Snowth-Advisory-Limit` field when proxying to other nodes during graphite-style metric find operations.
* Fix missing data when queried using level index when levels are partially in WAL.
* Fix find timeouts so they're respected and stop processing once they're reached.
* Allow providing a `node_blacklist` field when running live shard reconstitutes. This will allow the reconstitute process to skip specific nodes.
* Improve loading times of RocksDB-backed shards.
* Remove from surrogate indexes on-disk surrogates that are tombstoned in subsequent files.
* Add optional `//histogram//rollup//@retention` config to delete histogram rollup shards after a specified amount of time.
* Restore functionality of lua `reg_v2` (linear/exponential regression) extension.
* Migrate to using an external library package for RoaringBitmap.
* Optimize surrogate lookup for presence of tombstones.
* [libmtev 2.4.4](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#244)

### Changes in 0.23.6[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0236) <a href="#changes-in-0236" id="changes-in-0236"></a>

2023-03-08

* Fix bug where old timestamps could cause inter-node replication to stall.

* Additional validations on metric timestamps on ingestion.
* Use HTTP connection pooling for graphite inter-node traffic.
* CAQL: Add `group_by:stddev/popvar/percentile/alwaysone`, `math:sgn` and inverse hyperbolic functions (`asanh`, `acosh`, `atanh`), `stats:alwaysone/count/var/popvar`, and `window/rolling:popvar`, `delta`, `changes`, `absent`, `resets`, `increase`, `last`, and `present`.
* Fix `stats.json` delay measurement value to reflect the node latency calculated in the gossip data.
* Update the `stats.json` delay measurement values at a more regular cadence to make sure that it reflects the current system state.
* Fix crash bug with empty histogram entries in `mvalue` and `inverse_quantile` extensions.

* CAQL: Add functions `stats:clamp`, `math:sqrt`, `math:log2`
* [libmtev 2.4.0](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#240)

### Changes in 0.23.4[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0234) <a href="#changes-in-0234" id="changes-in-0234"></a>

2023-01-03

**IMPORTANT: This release includes an update to the on-disk metric indexes. These will be rebuilt automatically when a node is restarted after updating to this version. This will result in the startup time for a node the first time after upgrading to be considerably longer. After the first boot, boot times should be consistently faster.**

* Add `fill:forward(limit=DUR)` function that will limit filling to the specified duration.
* Add `fill=forward:<ms>` as a `/fetch` param and tie into the optimizer.
* Add cluster-wide version tracking for `/fetch` to prevent CAQL over-optimization during upgrades.
* Fix handling of error returns when reading jlog interval.
* Discard incoming metrics that match the `//snowth//discard_data_filters/discard_data_filter` configured for the corresponding account, e.g., `<discard_data_filter account="1234" filter="and(__storage:false)"/>`
* New level index format that allows for faster loads and lowers memory usage. This requires regenerating the indexes on the first startup after upgrade.
* Reduce loading times for level indexes.
* Fix ingestion of multiple opentsdb records.
* [libmtev 2.3.9](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#239)

* [libmtev 2.3.4](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#234)

### Changes in 0.23.1[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0231) <a href="#changes-in-0231" id="changes-in-0231"></a>

2022-07-12

* Fix bug where doubles were being mistakenly cast to integers when returning the last known raw datapoints in `find/tags` calls.
* Fix error where when writing a copy of the last raw data point in a shard into the next shard, we could write a bad data point if no additional data had been written to that shard since the previous rollup.
* Fix crash in `/fetch` groupby in uncommon scenario when replication is stuck and the cluster is unstable.

* Find timeouts will now respect timeouts - either the default timeout, or ones set via the `X-Snowth-Timeout` header. Queries will stop evaluating once they detect that they are past the query deadline rather than running to completion.
* Change default find timeout from five minutes to one minute. Make the timeout value configurable via `find_optimization/@default_find_timeout` in the config file.
* Fix race conditions in fetches when encountering errors
* Fix find timeouts so nodes will break connections to remote nodes during proxy calls if the timeout is reached.
* Fix reconstitute bug where surrogate databases would get redownloaded even if they had already completed being reconstituted.
* Use separate jobqs for `tag_cats` and `tag_vals` find queries.
* Fix possible denial of service in reconstitute where the reconstituting node's requests could overwhelm the other nodes in the cluster.
* [libmtev 2.3.2](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#232)

### Changes in 0.23.0[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0230) <a href="#changes-in-0230" id="changes-in-0230"></a>

2022-06-08

**IMPORTANT: Changes to the surrogate database reconstitute process make reconstitute incompatible with earlier versions. Once at least one node has been updated to version 0.23.0, reconstitute operations will not succeed until all nodes have been updated to version 0.23.0.**

* Improvements to the surrogate format for transmission during reconstitute and rebalance.
* Reduce memory footprint and improve performance for `tag_cats` and `tag_vals` find queries.

* Fix shard reporting issues in stats.json.

### Changes in 0.22.0[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0220) <a href="#changes-in-0220" id="changes-in-0220"></a>

2022-05-18

**IMPORTANT: This release includes an update to rocksdb from version 5.8.8 to version 6.20.3. It is not possible to revert a node to a previous version once this version has been installed**

* Upgrade rocksdb from version `5.8.8` to version `6.20.3`
* Fix crash if pulling surrogate data during a reconstitute fails.
* Enable live single shard reconstitute for raw numeric and histogram shards.
* Fix deadlock when trying to delete a rolled up shard.
* `/extension/lua/caql_info` endpoint now accepts `query` in addition to `q`.
* `/extension/lua/caql_info` endpoint now returns post-optimized query.
* CAQL `forecasting:regression` now better supports streams with gaps.
* Fix bugs in side-aware finds where count only results would be incorrect and nodes always proxy to the opposite side instead of the local side.
* Implement `label:replace(...)` CAQL function for regex based label manipulation
* Added CAQL trigonometry functions (sin, cos, etc.)
* There now exists an option to configure the size of batches handled by `clean_rollup_suppressed_metrics` when rollup suppressed metrics are culled. It is `suppressed_rollup_delete_batch_size` in the `<raw_database>` config tag.
* Graphite find queries with `..` now correctly match nothing.
* `graphite_translate` additions/fixes to better match graphite behavior:
* Checking if too few arguments provided
* Add `/suggest/<accountid>/tags` auto-completion assistance endpoint.
* [libmtev 2.2.7](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#227)

### Changes in 0.21.3[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0213) <a href="#changes-in-0213" id="changes-in-0213"></a>

2022-04-22

**IMPORTANT: This update changes the format of the metric name database. The database will automatically be converted to the new format the first time the software boots. This will result in the first node bootup after upgrading to take longer than normal**

* Update internal version of the search index database (`metric_name_db`), which will cause the first restart after updating to this version to take longer than normal while the database regenerates.
* Make a variety of find queries utilize a single side (preferring local) when running a sided topology and a sufficient number of nodes are up.
* The find mgr will complete before all nodes have responded if it knows the answer to be complete.
* Fix `graphite_translate` test for `asPercent()`
* Fix CAQL queries to explicitly disallow queries on a single time point
* Removed usage of legacy fetch api (snowth.get)
* Find optimizations:
  * flatten nested and(and())
  * push limit context predicates down through hints.
* CAQL `find() | group_by:merge()` is now a user-facing error with explanation.
* Optimize `__type` and `__activity` finds.
* User friendly time ranges now support omission of start and end times on the `__activity` tag when using the `[epoch] - [epoch]` format (colon format does not allow omission). Corrected an issue where singular epoch times were allowed but should be an error.
* Allow setting of journal batch size and timeout via console `configure set`
* Fix CAQL optimization that could artificially limit `find` results if the pattern matched streams of a different data type.
* Fix heap use after free when removing rocksdb based raw shards
* `graphite_translate` additions/fixes to better match graphite behavior:
  * Fix `asPercent()` translation
* Make best node selection side aware.
* Allow CAQL `find` and friends to support a single argument with a tag search expression.
* Executor metrics updated to be more metrics 2.0 style. They are now tagged with the thread ID as `thread-name`, `queue_<#>_num_jobs` is now `size` with `units: messages`, and `queue_<#>_wait_time_hist_ms` and `queue_<#>_run_time_hist_ms` are now simply `wait_time` and `run_time` with the additional information tagged as stated above, `units: seconds` and "hist" removed from the name entirely. Metrics 1.0 changes include simply grouping by thread name rather than the superfluous internal details in place before.
* Make tag index searching release memory as it executes queries.
* `graphite:{aliasbynode,removenode,tagbynode}` now all support negative indexes.
* Removed falsely reported corruption message from reconstitute caused by empty shard files
* Added `-s [<period>,]<floor>,<ceiling>` commandline option for offline single shard reconstitute.
* CAQL `graphite:removenode` removing duplicate arguments instead of error:
  * `*WithWildards()` functions graphite translation allow duplicated arguments
* `graphite_translate` additions/fixes to better match graphite behavior:
  * Fix `hitcount()` translation
* [libmtev 2.2.5](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#225)

### Changes in 0.21.2[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0212) <a href="#changes-in-0212" id="changes-in-0212"></a>

2022-03-22

* Canonicalize inbound metrics without their measurement tags.
* Fix CAQL `graphite:aliasbynode` regression wherein label was unset.
* Add support for find hinting. This allows adding hints such as `and(hint(__check_uuid:<a uuid>,index:none))` that will make the search evaluate against an existing set rather than using the full metric index.
* Fix `egress_function` field updates in surrogate entries.
* Make `histogram:sum()` not normalize by default, `period=` behavior is unchanged. This is a change in the default.
* Make `find:sum()` not normalize by default and add a `period=` kwarg to support normalization.
* Add `op:div2` to CAQL strictly requiring two arguments. Make `/` use `op:div2`.
* Fix `/fetch` reductions of `sum` and `count` to return a stream of zeroes when zero metrics are requested.
* Change logic for finding best node to be smarter and find valid data more frequently.
* Shard status for hist-rollups now reporting to stats.json
* Add `math:ceil`, `math:round`, and `group_by:prod` to CAQL
* Allow operator to set jlog precommit buffer size on metadata feeds via `//metadata/@feed_precommit_size`.
* Add histogram merge pipeline reordering when trailing pipeline functions are commutative.
* Add CAQL `/fetch` optimization for `histogram:count()`, `histogram:count_above()`, `histogram:count_below()`, `histogram:rate_above()`, and `histogram:rate_below()`.
* Unoptimized `histogram:rate()` math fixed to match (correct) optimized version.
* Add `filter:sum:*` and `filter:not:sum:*` functions for graphite translation assistance.
* Shard status for raw and raw-hist now report to stats.json
* Add config setting `max_udp_payload_size_bytes` to set limit on gossip UDP packet sizes (default=1432).
* CAQL `stats:ratio()` now accepts `partition` or `partition_fmt` to calculate partition-relative ratios.
* CAQL `filter:latest:*` and `filter:not:latest:*` now have configurable lookback.
* Several `graphite_translate` additions/fixes to better match graphite behavior:
  * Fix translation issues with `asPercent()` and `divideSeriesLists()`
  * Add implementations for `minSeries()` and `grep()`
  * Added new functions - `currentAbove()`, `currentBelow()`, `filterSeries()` and `multiplySeriesWithWildcards()`
* Fixed a potential crash when manually triggering rollups.
* Reduce upper bound of default gossip interval from 2 seconds to 1.8 seconds. This avoids the occasional appearance of excess gossip latency in the Replication UI.
* Fix compatibility issues with CAQL function `graphite:aliassub`
* Improved check tag find search performance.
* Improved find search performance when using the `*:*` wildcard search.
* Add shard maintenance for raw numeric and raw/rollup histogram shards.
* When `/fetch` upgrades numerics to histograms, it now excludes NaNs.
* Graphite find endpoint will no longer return a 500 on a bad request, favoring the more accurate 400 error.
* Fix crash when attempting to fetch histogram shard data from the `/histogram_raw` endpoint when histogram shards are not enabled.
* Fix crash when enabling the monitor module using the legacy histogram database.
* Gossip messages modified to be larger and fewer in number. This is to fix an issue discovered where a large amount of UDP traffic was causing errors and spamming log files.
* DELETE on `/full/tags` now accepts the `X-Snowth-Advisory-Limit` header properly to limit the number of deletes that will occur in one operation. There is also a config-based maximum that may be set in `<snowth><rest><delete max_advisory_limit="" /></rest></snowth>` beyond which the limit set by `X-Snowth-Advisory-Limit` will not be respected. Additionally, this endpoint now returns the header `X-Snowth-Incomplete-Results: "true"` if the requested delete operation requires more deletes than allowed by `X-Snowth-Advisory-Limit` or the server-configured maximum. This helps ensure that very large deletes will not consume memory ad infinitum.
* [libmtev 2.2.2](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#222)

### Changes in 0.21.1[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0211) <a href="#changes-in-0211" id="changes-in-0211"></a>

2022-02-07

* Add explicit `histogram:random:` functions for each supported CDF.
* Fix bug where jlog subscribers could hang around for too long, causing journal data that should have been removed to remain on disk until the next time the node restarts.
* Change user-facing CAQL errors to 400 (from 520) HTTP codes.
* Implement `each:coalesce(X)` in CAQL.
* NNTBS shard states are now being reported to stats.json
* `vector:pack()` now takes a `meta` option that passed tag/name stream metadata through. The default (1) is to pass through metadata. This changes the default naming of unpacked vectors.
* `vector:pack()` now takes a `sloppy` option that allows colliding streams by vector index. The default (0) will throw a run-time error when two streams map to the same vector index.
* Finding an unconfigured shard on disk during boot will no longer result in a FATAL exit.
* CAQL histogram:sum() now support a period kwarg defaulting to 1M
* `/fetch` sums now normalize to 1s ranges and support override with period kwarg

* Add `rate_below` and `rate_above` transform operations for /fetch
* Add `each_rate_below` and `each_rate_above` reduce operations for /fetch
* Updated reporting of syntax errors in find tag queries to offer more in depth information to users
* Fix CAQL histogram:rate(period=X) where X is not 1s when optimization is on.
* Support smart quotes in CAQL for strings.
* CAQL is now strict for duration-typed arguments.
* Allow CAQL non-aggregate-safe CAQL functions to work on sub-minute periods.
* Fix table header on #internals web console.
* Prevent NNTBS timeshard manager from accidentally opening a shard in maintenance.
* Completely deprecate all system configuration via the `<pools>` stanza. New configuration will need to be done via the `<eventer>` stanza. Any existing `<pools>` values will be ignored and a warning message will print to the error log.
* Improve rollup efficiency by no longer rolling up raw numeric shards that fall entirely outside of all NNTBS retention windows.
* Make time shard resizes less frequent.
* Add `graphite:removenode` to CAQL.
* Modified the usage of `x-snowth-delete-rollups` to be accepted only on the `histogram_rollup` raw delete endpoint.
* Add a backlog table heading to the job queues admin interface.
* [libmtev 2.1.7](https://github.com/circonus-labs/libmtev/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#217)

### Changes in 0.21.0[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0210) <a href="#changes-in-0210" id="changes-in-0210"></a>

2022-01-07

**IMPORTANT: This update changes the format of the metric name database. The database will automatically be converted to the new format the first time the software boots. Once this has been done, the software cannot be reverted to previous versions unless you wipe out the contents of the metric name database first. If you need to downgrade for any reason after updating to this version, please contact Circonus support.**

* Remove deprecated `nnt` field from `/state` output.
* Fix potential crash when bad data points are found during raw data rollups
* Fix `tag_cats` and `tag_vals` endpoints to respect the `X-Snowth-Advisory-Limit` header.
* Added ability to use relative time-based values for activity fields in `/find` queries. Previously, the `activity_start_secs` and `activity_end_secs` fields had to be provided in epoch seconds. The string `now` will be accepted as a field. It will use the current time. You may also use values like `+10s` to indicate "ten seconds from now' or `-10s` to indicate "ten seconds ago". For example: a query that reads `activity_start_secs=-1d&activity_end_secs=now` will pull records that have activity data in the last day. A full list of accepted formats for these new values can be found [here](https://circonus-labs.github.io/libmtev/config/time_durations.html)
* Improve metric database loading times.
* Improve CAQL error messages.
* Fix bug where find requests were not respecting the default limit if no limit was manually specified.
* `graphite_translate` additions/fixes to better match graphite behavior:
  * new functions - `add()`, `movingMin()`, `randomWalk()`, `stddevSeries()`, `pow()` and `powSeries()`
  * `pieMin()`, `pieAverage()` and `pieMax()` implemented as `min()`, `avg()` and `max()`
  * all sorting and pictire manipulation functions implemented as pass()
* Fix race condition on old shard removal that can cause corruption.
* Improve `find` query performance in some pathological cases.
* Fix possible crash when deleting a timeshard while it's also being resized.
* Fix graphite `irondb_tag_filter` search bug that prevented query proxying.
* Fix potential crash when invalid histogram journal data is received by a node.
* Reconstitute recovery from errors on the sending nodes has been partially automated. It now automatically skips shards on errors from the sending node after a configurable number of retries and will retry them once more after finishing all the well-behaving shards. Upon completion, a final list of shards that could not be successfully reconstituted will be recorded in the `errorlog`, allowing further diagnosis and actions to be taken by the operator as needed. Shards which are in maintenance will also be skipped and retried in a similar way.
* Fix `/find/X/active_count` to respect `query` querystring parameter and to force `activity_start_secs` and `activity_end_secs` into activity window alignment.
* Allow `graphite/find` to accept an optional `irondb_tag_filter` query string parameter. This parameter will take a circonus-style tag-query and filter the metrics down to only include matching metrics.
* Fix bug in rollup scheduler that could cause rollups to get scheduled to run multiple times.
* Improve reconstitute stability.
* Fix incorrectly formatted error message when receiving invalid graphite input.
* Fix potential crash on bad fetches from CAQL.
* Fix bug in reconstitute that caused unnecessary replaying of data, slowing down the recovery process after a node finishes reconstituting.
* Improved `/fetch` error handling in CAQL.
* Aligned fetch remote client-side timeout with expressed server-side timeout.
* Clip off the right number of leading branch names in graphite results when using prefixes with wildcards.
* Add `filter:not` CAQL namespace for `any`,`all`,`min`,`max`, and `mean` that inverts the stream selection outcome.
* GET requests to the `/rollup/<check_uuid>/<metric>` endpoint that request data for which no rollup exists now return a `400: Bad Request` error response.
* Remove unused `/find/<account_id>/all` endpoint.
* Expand CAQL durations to support all mtev duration units.

* If corruption is detected in an NNTBS shard, offline it instead of exiting with a fatal error.
  *   Operators should be on the lookout for `errorlog` messages matching one of these patterns:

      ```
      Error committing txn: <return code> (error description)
      Error putting to lmdb cursor: <return code> (error description)
      ```

      If these logs appear, contact Circonus Support for help in remediating the issue.

2021-03-24

* Update artmap file version from 1 to 2. Metric artmap files will regenerate upon updating to this version, increasing search accuracy. This will cause the first bootup after upgrading to this version slower than normal, as the files will need to be rebuilt.
* Fix potential crash when fetching metrics with very large names.
* Fix potential deadlock in raw database rollups.
* Improved web UI performance: the Replication Latency tab now won't update unless it's visible.

**IMPORTANT: If you are using irondb-relay, you must update the irondb cluster to at least version 0.19.15 before updating irondb-relay to version 0.0.45 or later to avoid a disruption in your data**

* Improvements to activity tracking accuracy.
* Added optional logging and increased error reporting for raw shard rollups and deletes.
* Improve accuracy when compacting metricsdb by accounting for out-of-order surrogates arriving.

2020-08-27

* Update default configuration template to include two additional listener attributes for the main 8112 listener. These improve performance, especially at higher ingestion rates.
  * `accept_thread=on` dedicates a thread to handling new connections.
  * `fanout=true` distributes new events from accepted connections across threads in the default eventer pool.
* Add a ranked system for determing which egress function to use when selecting results via graphite queries. This will use the value we determine to be the "best" using an internal algorithm rather than using the first result we saw, which was the previous behavior.

When not in IRONdb (CAQL-broker) maintain the pre-existing default (search: external, find: internal). Allow config-based override of these extra-IRONdb defaults.
* Add the `impl` keyword arg to both `search:metric:...()` and `find:...()` to allow statement-based selection of internal or external search expansion.
* Implement vector:pack() and vector:unpack() in CAQL. These are experimental.

* Change `/find//active_count` API to use the `count_only` methodology from find which is faster and more memory efficient, but yields estimates when nodes are down.
* Support `__type:(numeric|histogram|text)` in tag searching. Does not support pattern matching.
* Add `lmdb_flags` attribute to `nntbs` and `metadata` nodes in config to allow for better control. Change to drop `MDB_NOMEMINIT` by default as the performance implications aren't significant. Drop `MDB_NOSYNC` from the default `metadata` flags.
* Allow nntbs timeshards to recover when bad data is encountered and add `.db.nntbs.errors` (`errors|ST[db-type:nntbs,...]`) statistic.
* Move module initialization startup messages out of the error log and into the startup log.
* Fix bug where we would attempt to abort LMDB transaction after failed commits, which can cause double frees.

2018-07-05

This release brings several major new features and represents months of hard work by our Engineering and Operations teams.

* New feature: [Stream Tags](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/metric-names-tags-queries/)
  * These are tags that affect the name of a metric stream. They are represented as `category:value` pairs, and are [searchable](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/metric-names-tags-queries/#tag-queries).
  * Each unique combination of metric name and tag list counts as a new metric stream for licensing purposes.
* New feature: [Activity Tracking](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/administration/activity-tracking)
  * Quickly determine time ranges when a given metric or group of metrics was being collected.
* New feature: Configurable [rollup retention](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/getting-started/configuration/#nntbs) for numeric data.
  * Retention is per rollup period defined in configuration.
* Operations: There is a one-time operation on the first startup when upgrading to version `0.12`.
  * As part of Stream Tags support, the [metric\_name\_database](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/getting-started/configuration/#metric_name_database) has been combined with another internal index and is no longer stored separately on disk.
  * The metric name database was always read into memory at startup. After the one-time conversion, its information will be extracted from the other index on subsequent startups. The time to complete the conversion includes the same amount of time to read the existing metric name database as well as to write out an updated index entry for each record encountered. Therefore, it is proportional to the number of unique metric streams stored on this node.
* Operations: The `raw_database` option [rollup\_strategy](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/getting-started/configuration/#raw_database-rollup_strategy) now defaults to `raw_iterator` if not specified.
  * If upgrading with a config that does not specify a `rollup_strategy`, an active rollup operation will start over on the timeshard it was processing.
* Operations: Add the ability to [cancel a sweep delete](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/api/data-deletion/#cancelling-a-sweep-delete) operation.
* Operations: Remove the reconstitute-reset option (`-E`) and replace with a more complete solution in the form of a script, `reset_reconstitute`, that will enable the operator to remove all local data and start a fresh rebuild.
* CAQL: add methods `time:epoch()` and `time:tz()`
* Installer: use default ZFS recordsize (128K) for NNT data. This has been shown experimentally to yield significantly better compression ratios. Existing installations will not see any change. To immediately effect these changes on an existing install, issue the following two commands:

```
zfs inherit -r recordsize <pool>/irondb/data
zfs inherit -r recordsize <pool>/irondb/nntbs
```

where `<pool>` is the zpool name. Users of versions < [0.11.1](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0111) can omit the second command (this dataset will not be present.) The recordsize change only affects new writes; existing data remains at the previous recordsize. If the full benefit of the change is desired, a [node rebuild](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/administration/rebuilding-nodes) may be performed.

* Documentation: Raw Submission API documentation for already required X-Snowth-Datapoints header
* Documentation: Text and Histogram deletion APIs were out of date.
* Documentation: Update formatting on API pages, which were auto-converted from a previous format.
* Performance and stability fixes too numerous to list here, though there are some highlights:
  * Converted UUID handling from libuuid to libmtev's [faster implementation](http://circonus-labs.github.io/libmtev/apireference/c.html#u).
  * Optimized replication speed.

2018-03-08

* Add an offline NNT to NNTBS conversion mode.
  * Default conversion is "lazy", as NNT metrics are read.
  * For read-heavy environments this may produce too much load, so the offline option can be used to take one node at a time out of the cluster and batch-convert all its NNT files to NNTBS block storage.
* Performance improvements to gossip replication, avoids watchdog timeout in some configurations.
* Fix several crash bugs in reconstitute, NNTBS, and journaling.
* Silence noisy error printing during NNTBS conversion.
* Formatting fix to a gossip error message (missing newline).

Configuration changes:

* Add a "startup" log to shift certain initialization logs out of the errorlog.
  * Reduces clutter and makes it easier to see when your instance is up and running.
  * New installs will have this log enabled by default, written to `/irondb/logs/startuplog` and rotated on the same policy as `errorlog`.
  * To enable on an existing installation, add this line to `/opt/circonus/etc/irondb.conf`, in the `<logs>` stanza (on a single line):

```
<log name="notice/startup" type="file" path="/irondb/logs/startuplog"

2017-12-18

* Improve rollup speed by iterating in a more natural DB order, with additional parallelization.
* The `setup-irondb` script will now log its output, in addition to stdout. It will log to `/var/log/irondb-setup.log` and if run multiple times will keep up to five (5) previous logs.

2017-11-09

* IRONdb now supports listening via the [Pickle protocol](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/getting-started/configuration/#pickle-listener).

Multiple `whisper2nnt` changes:

* Add `--writecount` argument for limiting the number of data points submitted per request
* Submit to the primary owning node for a given metric
* Disable HTTP keepalive
* Add `--find_closest_name` parameter. This is needed for sites that do name manipulation via modules in the metric\_name\_db and submit metrics with one name but search on them with another name. For example, a metric would get submitted that resembles `foo.bar_avg` and returned from the metric\_name\_db as `foo.bar`. Ingestion of whisper data has to use the `foo.bar_avg` name but whisper files on disk do not follow this format. To combat this a new switch which uses the `/graphite/metrics/find` url to lookup an already ingested name based on the whisper name as a prefix and uses that name for metric submission under NNT.

### Changes in 0.10.7[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0107) <a href="#changes-in-0107" id="changes-in-0107"></a>

* whisper2nnt: include in submission those archives with a period coarser than the minimum
* whisper2nnt: re-raise exception after two consecutive submission failures
* Better error handling for topology loading failures
* Several memory-related bug fixes

Documentation changes:

* The IRONdb Relay installer no longer insists on ZFS, and creates directories instead.
* Explicitly document that cluster resize/rebalance does not support changes to "sidedness". A new cluster and full reconstitute is required for changing to/from a sided cluster.

### Changes in 0.10.5[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-0105) <a href="#changes-in-0105" id="changes-in-0105"></a>

2017-10-04

* New replication protocol format, utilizing Google FlatBuffers. **This is a backward-incompatible change.** A typical rolling upgrade should be performed, but nodes will not send replication data until they detect FlatBuffer support on the other end. As a result, there may be increased replication latency until all nodes are upgraded.
* Improved error handling during reconstitute.

Documentation changes:

* New page documenting [cluster resizing](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/administration/resizing-clusters/) procedures.
* Add system tuning suggestions to the [Installation page](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/getting-started/manual-installation/#system-tuning).

2017-09-13

* Split graphite metric fetches into separate threads for node-local vs. remote to improve read latency
* Provide a configuration option for toggling LZ4 compression on journal sends (WAL replay to other cluster nodes). The default is on (use compression) and is best for most users.
  * To disable compression on journal sends, set an attribute `send_compressed="false"` on the `<journal>` node in `irondb.conf`.

Documentation changes:

* Added instructions for [rebuilding failed or damaged nodes](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/administration/rebuilding-nodes/)

### Changes in 0.9.8[​](https://docs.circonus.com/irondb/release-notes-archive#changes-in-098) <a href="#changes-in-098" id="changes-in-098"></a>

2017-07-13

*   Support for parallelizing rollups, which can be activated by adding a "rollup" element to the `<pools>` section of `irondb.conf`, with a "concurrency" attribute:

    ```
    <pools>
      ...
      <rollup concurrency="N"/>
    </pools>
    ```

    where `N` is an integer in the range from 1 up to the value of `nnt_put` concurrency but not greater than 16. If not specified, rollups will remain serialized (concurrency of 1). A value of 4 has been shown to provide the most improvement over serialized rollups.
