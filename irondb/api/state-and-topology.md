## Retrieving Gossip JSON Data

This API call retrieves gossip information from a IRONdb node. Gossip data is information on how the nodes are communicating with each other and if any nodes are behind other nodes with regards to data replication.

Data will be returned as an array of JSON objects. The format of these objects is described below.

API description: See "Internal Observability" in the [Administration API](https://apidocs.apica.io/irondb/admin/index.html)

### Gossip JSON Output

Each object in the array has the following form:

* `id` : The UUID of the node whose gossip information follows.
* `gossip_time` : The last time, in seconds, that this node received a gossip message.
* `gossip_age` : The difference, in seconds, between the last time this node received a gossip message and the current time.
* `topo_current` : The topology that is currently in use.
* `topo_next` : The "next" topology to use. A value of "-" indicates there is no next topology.
* `topo_state` : The state of the current topology. This will indicate the current rebalance state, or `n/a` if no rebalance is in progress.
* `latency` : An object that contains information on how far this node is lagging behind the other nodes. The entries will include the following:
  * `<uuid>` : The UUID of the node to which the current node is being compared.
  * `<latency_seconds>` : The number of seconds that the current node is behind the specified node.


## Retrieving Gossip XML Data

This API call retrieves gossip information from a Snowth node. Gossip data is information on how the nodes are communicating with each other and if any nodes are behind other nodes with regards to data replication.

Data will be returned an XML object. The format of this object is described below.

API description: See "Internal Observability" in the [Administration API](https://apidocs.apica.io/irondb/admin/index.html)

### Gossip XML Output

* `<nodes>` : The top-level element for the topology.
  * `<node>` : The container for all the information for a single node in the cluster. There will x of these elements, where "x" is the number of nodes in the cluster.
    * Attributes:
      * `id` : The UUID of the node whose gossip information follows.
      * `gossip_time` : The last time, in seconds, that this node received a gossip message.
      * `gossip_age` : The difference, in seconds, between the last time this node received a gossip message and the current time.
      * `topo_current` : The topology that is currently in use.
      * `topo_next` : The "next" topology to use.
      * `topo_state` : The state of the current topology.
    * `<latency>` : The element containing latency information for all non-local nodes.
      * `<node>` : The element containing latency information for a non-local node.
        * Attributes:
          * `id` : The UUID of the node to which the current node is being compared.
          * `diff` : The number of seconds that the current node is behind the specified node.
