# Policy

## Overview

A policy outlines access control to specific resources by specifying the actions users are permitted to perform.

**Components of a Policy:**

* Policy Name: A unique identifier for the policy that clearly describes its purpose or scope. It helps administrators quickly recognize and manage policies within the system.
* Permissions: The specific actions allowed or denied by the policy. Permissions define what resources the policy applies to and what operations users can perform on those resources (e.g., read, write, delete).
