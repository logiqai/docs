# Permissions

## Overview

Permissions are essential for regulating access to a resource, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Different levels of permissions can be assigned, ranging from read-only access, where users can view the data without making alterations, to full control, allowing users to modify and manage the resource completely.&#x20;

**Components of a Permission:**

* Permission Name: A unique label for each permission within the policy.
* Resources: The specific assets or data (e.g., databases, files, services) that the permission controls access to.
* Actions: The operations permitted on the resources, such as read, write, delete, or execute.

### &#x20;Permissions types and scopes

All policies created by users are categorized as customer-managed policies. These policies provide full flexibility in defining:

* Permission names
* Resources (e.g., data sources, services)
* Actions (e.g., read, write, delete)

This allows organizations to tailor access control based on specific roles, data sensitivity, and operational requirements.
