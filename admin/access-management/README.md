Access Management is the process of controlling who can access specific resources, features, or data within a system. It ensures that only authorized users have the right level of access based on their roles or responsibilities. This helps maintain security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) simplifies access management by organizing users into roles that define what actions they can perform and which resources they can access. Instead of assigning permissions to users individually, permissions are granted to roles â€” and users inherit those permissions by being assigned to one or more roles. The more roles a user has, the broader their access across the system.
* Roles can represent job functions (like Admin, Developer, Viewer) or project-specific responsibilities, offering a flexible and scalable way to manage access.
