# Group Management

## Overview

Groups are a way to organize users with similar roles or responsibilities. Instead of assigning permissions or roles individually, administrators can manage access at the group level â€” making user management more efficient and scalable. Groups are especially useful in large teams where members need the same set of permissions.

**Components of a Group:**

1. Group Name: A unique and descriptive identifier for the group, representing the function within the organization.
2. Assigned Roles: One or more roles linked to the group that define the specific permissions and access rights granted to users under this group.
3. Assigned users: The users assigned to the group, determining who inherits the associated permissions of the roles.
