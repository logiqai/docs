# Log Explained using Generative AI

## Log Explained Introduction

One often encounters cryptic log events that need to be understood to resolve system observative challenges such as system troubleshooting, meeting SLO requirements, etc. This extra investigation is usually resolved using external tools such as an online search engine or even an outside ChatGpt prompt window, which results in extra workload for the user.   Ascent Data-Fabric platform (ADF) comes with the ability of Generative AI technology to handle the task efficiently.

The admin must first set up ADF by configuring it with a Generative AI backend engine: language model, endpoint, and APIKey. Once the configuration is done, the user will get seamless experience exploring and investigating log events using the power of GenAI.&#x20;
