# Alerts

Apica Ascent offers Alerts feature that notifies users when specific conditions are met within the data. Alerts can be set up in two ways:

1. **From the Create Menu:**
   * Navigate to **Create > Alert** to set up a new alert.
2. **From a Log Line in the Explore Page:**
   * Select a log line and choose the option to create an log2metric.
3. **From a widget in data explorer:**
   * Hover over the more(ellipses) icon in a data explorer widget and create alerts with multiple thresholds and severities.

Additionally, users can configure alert destinations to specify where notifications should be sent when alerts are triggered. To create a new alert destination, go to **Settings > Alert Destinations**.
