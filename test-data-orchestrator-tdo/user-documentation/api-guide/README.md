# API Guide

Within each functional area, the API’s are capable of:

·       Create new item

·       Get all items (needed to get the internal ID for any item you want to update, get details, or delete)

·       Update item

·       Get item details

·       Delete item

·       Lock/Unlock item (Coverage Sets and Work Sets)

&#x20;

In order to execute any of these functions: update, delete, get item details, lock, or unlock you need to first run the ‘get all’ API to get the item’s internal ID which is then sent in the action API.&#x20;

&#x20;In this document, Postman (free version) is used to demonstrate how each API should be set up and used and show the expected response formats.
