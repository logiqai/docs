# Terminology

Logs are organized by cluster\_id, namespaces, applications, and their processes.

### CLUSTER\_ID

CLUSTER\_ID is an optional label that can be applied to incoming data streams. E.g. it is a good practice to apply CLUSTER\_ID to a K8S cluster. All namespaces from the K8S cluster will get prefixed with CLUSTER\_ID so the user can distinguish between namespace name collisions across different clusters.

For Kubernetes clusters, CLUSTER\_ID is an attribute added to the JSON payload by the sending agent for e.g. Fluentd or Fluent-bit. [See here for on how to manage multiple clusters](../integrations/agentless/#managing-multiple-k-8-s-clusters-in-a-single-logiq-instance).

### Namespace

The namespace is the top of the hierarchy. For a Kubernetes based deployment namespace maps to Kubernetes namespace and for non-Kubernetes based deployment it maps to the host-name of the virtual machine or physical host.

### Application & Process

In the Kubernetes based deployments Application refers to deployment name and process refers to its pod names. For example for Nginx application (deployment/service) may have multiple pods which are its processes.&#x20;

For the physical machine, the application refers to process names like Nginx or tomcat and process refers to process id.

There are multiple ways you can access the logs.&#x20;

* The Logs page hierarchically arranges logs by Namespace, application and process. It lets you see the most recent logs for the process&#x20;
* The Search page allows you to search through logs.
* The `logiqctl` command line tool allows you to view logs in realtime.&#x20;
