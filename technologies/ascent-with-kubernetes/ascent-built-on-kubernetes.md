# Ascent: Built on Kubernetes

## Apica Ascent: Built on Kubernetes for Ultimate Scale & Performance

Observability isn’t just about collecting logs, metrics, and traces—it’s about ensuring real-time insights, high performance, and cost-efficiency at any scale. Traditional monitoring solutions often struggle with large-scale data ingestion, leading to performance bottlenecks, slow query times, and high storage costs.

Apica’s Ascent Platform, built on Kubernetes, solves these challenges by providing infinite scalability, AI-driven optimization, and seamless multi-cloud support. With a unified data store, OpenTelemetry-native architecture, and intelligent workload management, Apica delivers unparalleled observability performance while reducing operational complexity and costs.

### InstaStore™: Kubernetes-Powered Unified Telemetry Data Lake

One of the biggest challenges in observability is data storage and retention. Traditional monitoring solutions rely on tiered storage models, leading to high costs, data fragmentation, and slow query times.

Apica’s InstaStore™ data lake, built on Kubernetes, eliminates these limitations by providing:

* Infinite scalability – Stores billions of logs, traces, and metrics without performance degradation.
* ZeroStorageTax architecture – No more storage tiering, reducing storage costs by up to 60%.
* Real-time data indexing – Instant query access to historical and real-time telemetry data.
* Multi-cloud compatibility – Supports AWS S3, Azure Blob, Ceph, MinIO, and other object storage providers.

#### How InstaStore™ Enhances Observability Performance

* Single source of truth – Eliminates data silos by storing logs, metrics, traces, and events in a unified repository.
* On-demand query acceleration – Uses high-speed indexing for sub-second query response times.
* Long-term retention & compliance – SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA-compliant storage for enterprise observability data.

**Result:** Enterprises can store, query, and analyze observability data instantly, at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions.

### Ascent Flow (Telemetry Pipeline): Data Flow Optimization at Scale

Observability pipelines must ingest, process, and export massive volumes of telemetry data while maintaining low latency and high efficiency. Without proper optimization, unstructured data overloads monitoring systems, leading to delays, noise, and unnecessary costs.

Apica’s Telemetry Pipeline, built on Kubernetes, solves this by:

* Filtering, enriching, and transforming telemetry data in real time.
* Automatically routing observability data to the most cost-effective storage backend.
* Optimizing ingestion rates to reduce infrastructure costs and enhance performance.
* Providing a drag-and-drop interface for managing data pipelines effortlessly.

### Fleet Management: Automated Deployment & Scaling of Observability Agents

#### The Challenge: Managing Observability Agents at Scale

In modern enterprise environments, observability data is collected from thousands of microservices, virtual machines, containers, and cloud functions. Manually deploying, configuring, and maintaining OpenTelemetry agents, Fluent-bit log collectors, and Prometheus exporters is resource-intensive and error-prone.

* Config drift leads to inconsistent telemetry data across environments.
* Manual agent updates result in security vulnerabilities and broken data pipelines.
* Lack of centralized management makes troubleshooting difficult.

#### Apica’s Fleet Management: Kubernetes-Powered Automation

Apica solves these challenges with Fleet Management, an automated system for managing OpenTelemetry collectors and other observability agents at enterprise scale.

* Automated Agent Deployment – Uses Kubernetes DaemonSets and StatefulSets to deploy and manage observability agents across clusters.
* Zero-Drift Configuration Management – Ensures all observability agents stay in sync with the latest configurations.
* Real-Time Health Monitoring – Continuously tracks agent status, performance, and data collection efficiency.
* Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Support – Deploys agents across AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem environments, and edge locations.

**Result:** Enterprises eliminate manual observability agent management, ensuring consistent, reliable telemetry collection at scale.
