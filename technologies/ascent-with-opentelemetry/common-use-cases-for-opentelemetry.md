# Common Use Cases for OpenTelemetry

## Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

**End-to-end distributed tracing for microservices:** OpenTelemetry enables deep visibility into microservices interactions by capturing traces across service boundaries. This allows developers and operations teams to understand request flow, identify problematic dependencies, and detect failures in a distributed system. By leveraging OpenTelemetry’s context propagation, teams can follow a request from its origin to its termination, providing a clear picture of dependencies and bottlenecks. This improves troubleshooting efficiency, reduces the mean time to resolution (MTTR), and helps organizations build more resilient, scalable architectures. Additionally, OpenTelemetry supports integrations with distributed tracing backends such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and commercial solutions, ensuring flexibility in visualization and analysis.

**Identifying latency bottlenecks in cloud-native environments:** By collecting granular performance data, OpenTelemetry helps teams pinpoint where delays are occurring in an application. Whether it’s a slow database query, an overloaded service, or network latency, OpenTelemetry provides the data needed to optimize system responsiveness and improve user experience. With built-in support for metrics and histograms, OpenTelemetry allows teams to measure request duration, throughput, and error rates, enabling proactive performance tuning. Furthermore, OpenTelemetry facilitates real-time alerting on latency spikes, allowing DevOps teams to quickly diagnose and mitigate issues before they impact users. This level of insight is particularly beneficial for cloud-native applications where dynamic scaling and complex service interactions demand constant monitoring and optimization.

**Collecting host and container-level metrics:** OpenTelemetry provides extensive support for collecting system-level and container-level metrics, including CPU, memory, disk usage, and network statistics. This enables teams to track resource consumption across distributed environments, identify performance anomalies, and optimize infrastructure utilization. By leveraging OpenTelemetry’s support for metric aggregation and real-time monitoring, organizations can ensure their applications remain resilient under varying workloads.

**Monitoring Kubernetes clusters at scale:** Kubernetes environments introduce unique challenges due to their dynamic and ephemeral nature. OpenTelemetry integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes to provide real-time visibility into cluster health, pod performance, and service-to-service communications. It enables DevOps teams to monitor workload scheduling efficiency, detect failing pods, and correlate application performance with underlying infrastructure issues. By centralizing observability across multiple clusters, OpenTelemetry empowers organizations to maintain high availability and reduce operational overhead in cloud-native environments.

## Log Correlation with Traces and Metrics <a href="#toc189582873" id="toc189582873"></a>

**Unified observability for root cause analysis:** OpenTelemetry provides a comprehensive approach to observability by linking logs, metrics, and traces together, enabling teams to perform in-depth root cause analysis. By correlating log events with specific traces and spans, teams can identify exactly where failures occur within a distributed system, reducing the time spent diagnosing incidents and improving mean time to resolution (MTTR). This unified observability approach ensures that developers and operators have a complete understanding of system behavior, making debugging and performance optimization more efficient.

**Enriching logs with trace and span context:** OpenTelemetry enhances logging by automatically injecting trace and span identifiers into log messages, allowing for precise contextualization of events. This enrichment enables teams to follow an event from initiation through completion, offering clear insights into request flow and dependencies. Additionally, integrating log correlation with tracing helps detect patterns, anomalies, and dependencies that might not be immediately visible when logs are analyzed in isolation. This capability is especially beneficial in microservices architectures, where tracking down issues across multiple services can be complex without proper log-trace correlation.

## Security and Compliance Observability <a href="#toc189582874" id="toc189582874"></a>

**Capturing audit trails with OTEL logs and traces:** OpenTelemetry enables organizations to create detailed audit trails by collecting logs and traces that capture user activity, API calls, and system interactions. These audit trails help organizations meet compliance requirements by providing clear, verifiable records of all system activities. By maintaining an immutable record of telemetry data, OpenTelemetry enhances accountability and security, ensuring that organizations can detect and investigate security incidents efficiently.

**Detecting anomalies and unauthorized access patterns:** OpenTelemetry’s advanced telemetry data collection allows security teams to analyze trends, detect anomalies, and identify unauthorized access attempts in real-time. By correlating logs, traces, and metrics, OpenTelemetry provides a holistic view of system behavior, helping teams recognize suspicious patterns, mitigate security threats, and prevent potential data breaches. This proactive security monitoring is essential for maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data in distributed and cloud-native environments.

## Business Analytics and SLO Monitoring <a href="#toc189582875" id="toc189582875"></a>

**Defining Service Level Objectives (SLOs):** Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are key performance indicators (KPIs) that define the desired reliability and performance targets for services. OpenTelemetry enables organizations to collect and analyze telemetry data that aligns with predefined SLOs, ensuring services meet business expectations. By leveraging OpenTelemetry metrics, organizations can measure service uptime, response times, and error rates, allowing teams to proactively address performance degradations before they impact end users. This approach fosters a culture of reliability engineering and helps teams adhere to Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

**Analyzing user behavior and optimizing transactions:** OpenTelemetry provides deep insights into user interactions and application workflows by capturing traces and metrics across distributed systems. By analyzing user journeys, organizations can identify friction points, optimize performance, and enhance user experience. OpenTelemetry allows businesses to track critical transactions, detect drop-offs, and correlate them with system behavior, ensuring continuous improvement. Additionally, businesses can leverage telemetry data to fine-tune application logic, allocate resources efficiently, and personalize user interactions based on real-time performance trends.
