# Policy Management

## Overview

Policies define the rules and permissions that govern access to resources within the platform. They are used to control who can access what, and what actions they are allowed to perform. Policies are typically assigned through roles and can be applied at the role level.

In Apica Ascent, policies enable administrators to enforce consistent, secure, and role-based access control (RBAC) across the platform. Each policy consists of a set of permissions that determine access to specific functionalities or data.

By managing policies effectively, organizations can ensure compliance, minimize risk, and maintain operational efficiency.\
