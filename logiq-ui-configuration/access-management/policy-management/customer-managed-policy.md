# Customer Managed Policy

## Overview

Customer Managed Policies allow organizations to define and tailor access controls based on specific business requirements. Unlike Apica Managed policies, custom policies offer full flexibility, enabling administrators to create fine-grained permissions for users, groups, or services.

#### Key Characteristics:

* Fully Configurable: Define exactly which actions are permitted and on which resources.
* Granular Access Control: Apply the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions.
* Organization-Specific: Designed to meet unique operational, compliance, or security needs.
* Modifiable: Custom policies can be edited, updated, or removed as needed.
