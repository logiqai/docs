# Role Management

## Overview

Roles define user access levels using policies. They control what actions users can perform and which resources they can access based on what policies are assigned to the roles. Roles can be built-in or custom, allowing flexible and secure access management. Users can be assigned to roles which control what user has what access. Assigning the right role ensures users have only the permissions they need.

**Components of a Role:**

1. Role Name: A unique and descriptive identifier for the role, representing the access level or function within the organization.
2. Assigned Policies: One or more policies linked to the role that define the specific permissions and access rights granted to users with this role.
3. Assigned users: The users assigned to the role, determining who inherits the associated permissions.
4. Assigned Groups: A group of users assigned to a role. All the members of the group will inherit the group policies.
