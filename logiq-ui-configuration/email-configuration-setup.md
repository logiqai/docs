2. Mail service/relay port for SMTP e.g. 25 or 465/587 \(TLS/SSL\)
3. Username for the mail service/relay
4. Password for the user above in 3
5. Default Sender E-Mail: The send e-mails will show up as from this sender
6. Depending on what port you are using and support at the mail service/relay, select either SSL/TLS to be enabled
