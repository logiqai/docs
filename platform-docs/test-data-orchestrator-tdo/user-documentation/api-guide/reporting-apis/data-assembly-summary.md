# Data Assembly Summary

This call is run as a GET.  It uses the same three parameters as the other reporting API’s but uses two additional ones – projectname and projectversion.  If these parameters are used, you must use both of them.&#x20;

&#x20;This call returns a data assembly summary, including how many rows were generated and how many rows had errors.  If the ‘errors’ indicator is ‘\[ ]’ then there were no errors detected during data assembly.

&#x20;If there were errors, it includes information on the rows that contained errors and the number of errors per row.

&#x20;This result is for the project ‘mug\_test\_project 1.0’ and returned no errors.
