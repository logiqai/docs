# Reduce Business Rules using Priorities

If you have created determining attributes with priorities, and want to use the priorities to quickly reduce the number of rows generated by those rules based on priorities, this can be done quickly via this API call.

The call is sent as a PATCH call.  The ID of the rule you will be reducing is included in the URL. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This call only impacts a single rule.  If your coverage set has multiple rules, and you want to reduce them all, you will need to call this API for each rule individually.
{% endhint %}

The body of the call contains the context information, as well as the coverage set and the priorities you want to retain.  These priorities will be applied to all determining attributes that have priorities set.

```
{
	"context": {
		"user": "mbj_test",
		"password": "xxxx",
		"project": {
			"name": "mug_test_project",
			"version": "1.0"
		},
		"coverage" : {
		  "name": "mug_test_coverage",
		  "version": "1.1"
		},
		"params" : { "priorities" : [1,2] }
	}
}
```

The return message contains information on the rule, and all of the attribute values that have been retained after applying the priorities.

In TDO, the revised rule (rule 1) can be seen with only the priority 1 and 2 values in the currency fields.
