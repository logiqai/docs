# Lock Coverage Set

This call is sent to lock a coverage set in TDO – this will prevent any other user (within the UI or from automated API calls) from making changes to the coverage set or business rules while you are working within that coverage set.  It is sent as a ‘PATCH’.

Note that the header is slightly different (it includes the command ‘lock’ in addition to the coverage set ID.
