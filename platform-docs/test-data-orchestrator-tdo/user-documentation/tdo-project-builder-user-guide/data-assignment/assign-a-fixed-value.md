# Assign a Fixed Value

Fixed values are used when the same value applies to all fields in the file, or when a value remains consistent for a set condition.&#x20;

To create a fixed value assignment, select the field and create the rule container.  Click on the rule container to open the lower panes and click on 'Compose' in the 'Operands' pane.

For this action, you do not need to select a data source or field.  Simply the value you want to assign on the 'Reference Attribute/Value' line in the right hand (Operation) pane and click the blue plus sign to move it to the Operands pane at the bottom.  Click the 'Save' button to save the rule.
