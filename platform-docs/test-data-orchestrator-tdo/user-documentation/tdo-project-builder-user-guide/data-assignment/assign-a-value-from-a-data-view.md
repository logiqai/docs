# Assign a Value from a Data View

Assigning a value from a data view is very similar to assigning a value from the coverage matrix view. &#x20;

In the example below, we are assigning the external account number for the payment transaction from the 'external\_view' to the field 'crediting\_account'.  Click on the field name in the center pane, click the plus to create the rule, click on the rule name to open the bottom panes, and click on 'Compose' in the 'Operands pane to open the Rule window. &#x20;

In the left pane ('Sources') click on the view that the data is store in ('external\_view').  In the center pane, click on the field 'account\_number', and the click the blue plus sign in the right pane to apply this rule. &#x20;
