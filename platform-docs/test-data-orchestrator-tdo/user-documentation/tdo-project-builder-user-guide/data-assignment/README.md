# Data Assignment

Assignment Rules are how data is assigned to a field in the output format. It can be a value from the Coverage Matrix, from a Data View (i.e., a data source), from a previously created field in the same step or a previous step, a fixed value, or it can be generated using a TDO format function.  Assignment rules can also include conditions ("if - then") and can include multiple text or mathematical calculations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Data fields in the output file are presented in the order that the assignment rules are created, and not in the order that the fields appear in the output format file.  If the field sequence must match the output format, the rules must be created in that order.
{% endhint %}

To build business rules, select your project and workset. Then select 'Assignment Rules' from the 'Data Assembly' section of the menu.
