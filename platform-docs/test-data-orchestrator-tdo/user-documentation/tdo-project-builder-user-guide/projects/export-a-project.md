# Export a Project

You can export a project to create a backup or to move it to a different TDO server.  To export a project, hover your mouse to the right of the project information and click on the export icon (down arrow).

The export process will open a new tab in Chrome.  Once the download is complete, you will get a message that it has completeld and the new tab will close.

Depending on your network's security settings, you may need to click 'Keep' to complete the download process.  If you do not choose 'Keep' your download will be deleted.
