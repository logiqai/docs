# Delete a Project

Projects can only be deleted by users with Admin privileges.  If you do not have Admin rights, you will not see the delete (trash can) icon at the right of your object icons.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you delete a project, you will delete all objects in that project.  Projects should only be deleted when they are no longer needed, and any required retention periods are elapsed.
{% endhint %}

To delete a project, click in the check box to the left of the project name to select it then on the trash can icon to the right of the project name on the main project page.  TDO will open a confirmation window asking if you want to take this action; click 'OK' to delete and 'Cancel' if you want to stop the deletion process.

If you click 'OK' the project will be deleted and will no longer be available to select or assign to users.  A green success message will briefly pop up in the upper right corner of the page.
