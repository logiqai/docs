# Clone a Project

This function is used when you want to make a copy of an existing project on the same server – for instance, you want to use functionality from a previous release but want to make some minor changes.  This allows you to keep the existing project as-is and create the clone for your new work.  All artifacts in the existing project will be cloned.

To create a clone, hover your cursor to the right of the project you want to clone and click the ‘duplicate’ button (two pages with a ‘+’ sign on them, second icon from right).

This will open the clone window. Because you are creating a copy on the same server, you must provide a prefix. TDO will affix this prefix to every artifact in the project. Once you have entered the prefix, click on ‘Clone’ to create the project clone.

TDO will display a moving circle icon while the clone is in process.  Once the clone is completed, the new project is visible in your projects list.
