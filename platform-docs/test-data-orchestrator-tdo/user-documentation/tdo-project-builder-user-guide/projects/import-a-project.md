# Import a Project

This function can be used to move a project from one server to another (for instance, from your test server to your production server after testing is completed).

In the lower right-hand corner of the Projects window, click the up arrow to open the import menu.  Click on the blue document icon to open the file explorer and select the project you want to upload. (You will have to have downloaded a project previously to get the project file.)

You have the option of adding a prefix to the project file name (e.g., ‘1\_’) or importing it with no prefix.  In the case above, no prefix has been selected as this project is being imported from a different server.  If you are importing a project that already exists on your server, you will have to add a prefix.

Once the window is complete, click the ‘Import’ button to load the project.  Once loaded, it will appear on your projects list.&#x20;
