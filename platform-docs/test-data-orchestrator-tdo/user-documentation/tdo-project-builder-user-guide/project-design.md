# Project Design

Before you begin to build a project in TDO, you should clearly understand what your desired outcome is (what function your output file will be used for â€“ e.g., automated testing), what your input and output files will be, what your selection criteria will be, and other basic design items. You should create a project design document that contains all of these items to help guide you through the project setup process.

As with any development effort, attempting to set up a project without a clear design document will not always end in failure but it will take much longer to complete and require a significant amount of rework.

The file below is an example of a design spec for a project. Once you have reviewed this guide and understand the TDO components and relationships, you can use this as a guide to what you will need to know to build a spec for your projects.
