# Edit a Business Rule

Business rules can be modified as test conditions change.  To edit a business rule, hover your mouse to the right of the rule and click on the pencil to open the 'Create Business Rule' Window.

When you open this window, it will display the determining attribute values that have been selected in the right column.  To remove an existing selected value, click on it in the right hand column.  In the example below, we are removing the value 'pmt\_currency: SGD' from the selected list.

New values can be added to the rule by clicking on the attribute in the left column and selecting the value you want to add from the center column.  Here, we will add 'true' for 'has\_online' to this rule.
