# Using Occurrences in Business Rules

There will be times when you want to create multiple occurrences of the same test; this is generally to support high volume testing such as performance testing.  One way to get a high volume is to create multiple rules with many values. An easier way is to set the 'occurrences' value at the top of the 'Create Business Rules' window. &#x20;

Start by clicking the pencil to the right of the rule to open the 'Create Business Rule' window.  At the top left of the window is a line labeled 'Occurrences'.  By default, this will be populated with '1'.

Type the number of tests you want to run with each condition set in the business rule.   Then click the 'Set' button at the bottom of the window to save this change.  You will not see any changes in the business rules page when you do this; the impact of this setting will be seen in the Coverage Matrix.
