To delete a business rule, click the check box to the left of the rule and then hover to the right of the rule.  Click on the trash can icon to delete the rule.

TDO will pop up a message to confirm the deletion operation.  Click on 'OK' to delete the rule or 'Cancel' to keep it.

Once deleted, the rule will be removed from the business rules list.

To delete two or more rules at the same time, click the blue pencil to the left of all rules you want to delete.  Then click the trash can in the upper right corner of the business rules list pane.  This will bring up the deletion message. Click 'OK' to delete all checked rules.&#x20;

After deleting the selected rules, the business rules page will show what is left (in this case, no rules).
