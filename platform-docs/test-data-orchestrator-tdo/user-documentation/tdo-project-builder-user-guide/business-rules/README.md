# Business Rules

Business rules are a selection of values from all the Determining Attributes defined in your Coverage Set. You can have one or more Business Rules defined in your Coverage Set. Business Rules define the conditions to be tested and also define the data selection requirements for your test.

You can select one or more values from each determining attribute for each business rule. You want to make sure that the combinations selected will all result in valid test conditions (for positive testing) so in some cases you may need multiple rules to gather all possible test conditions required.
