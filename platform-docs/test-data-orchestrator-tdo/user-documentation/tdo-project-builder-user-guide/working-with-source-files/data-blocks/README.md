# Data Blocks

A Data Block is any .csv file that has been ingested into TDO, either manually or via API.  Data Blocks can be empty except for column headers (output file format) or can contain data (such as extract files) that is used as a source for assembly and to assign specific data to specific tests.

The next step is to verify the file data, update any field formats as needed, and identify any determining attributes.&#x20;

To do this, select ‘Data Blocks’ from the Data Management section of the menu.  This will present a list of all data blocks, using the data block name you assigned the file during the upload process.

Hover to the right of the file name (‘test\_file’) and click on the pencil to edit the file. Common edits during the validation stage are changing field data types, adding a format mask, and creating determining attributes and will be covered in the following pages.

You can search for a data block name from the top of the Data Blocks page.  in the top pane, next to the magnifying glass search symbol, type part or all of the name of the file you are looking for and hit 'enter'.  TDO will return a list of all files that match your entered search criteria.

To clear the search, click the 'x' in the search pane and then re-load the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
This search functionality is available on several TDO main pages.  Any time you see the top empty pane with the magnifying glass icon on the left side, you can perform the same search functionality on that page.

You can also change the number of rows displayed on a TDO page.  By default, TDO displays 10 rows of data.  At the bottom left, TDO lists the Rows per Page and Total Records.  Next to the Rows per Page is a downward pointing triangle; click on that to display the options.  Click on the desired number of rows to display per page to change the display.

{% hint style="info" %}
The rows per page option is also available on multiple pages.  Any time TDO shows the 'Rows per Page' with the downward triangle, the number of rows displayed can be changed from the default value.
