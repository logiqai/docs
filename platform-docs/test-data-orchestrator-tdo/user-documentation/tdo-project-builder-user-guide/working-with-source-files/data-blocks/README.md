# Data Blocks

A Data Block is any .csv file that has been ingested into TDO, either manually or via API.  Data Blocks can be empty except for column headers (output file format) or can contain data (such as extract files) that is used as a source for assembly and to assign specific data to specific tests.

The next step is to verify the file data, update any field formats as needed, and identify any determining attributes.&#x20;

To do this, select ‘Data Blocks’ from the Data Management section of the menu.  This will present a list of all data blocks, using the data block name you assigned the file during the upload process.

Hover to the right of the file name (‘test\_file’) and click on the pencil to edit the file. Common edits during the validation stage are changing field data types, adding a format mask, and creating determining attributes and will be covered in the following pages.
