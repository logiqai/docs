# Deleting a Work Set

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only a user with Admin rights can delete a Work Set.  If you do not have Admin rights, you will not see the delete button (trash can).
{% endhint %}

To delete a work set, click the blue check box to the left of the work set name and then the trash can icon to the right of the work set name.  When the confirmation message pops up, click 'OK' to delete.

Note that once a work set is deleted, it cannot be restored.  All items associated with the work set, such as data assignment rules, are permanently deleted.
