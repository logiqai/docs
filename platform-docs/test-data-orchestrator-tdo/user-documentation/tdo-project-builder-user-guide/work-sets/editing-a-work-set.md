# Editing a Work Set

Once a work set has been created, it can be edited if necessary.  Generally, you will only edit it to update source data block versions or add a new data view.

Click the blue pencil to the right of the work set name to open the 'Edit Work Set' window.  From here, you can change the scenario, primary data view, or associated data block in the top pane by clicking on the blue pencil icon associated with that item and selecting a new item from the pop up list.

To add a data view, click the blue pencil in the top right of the lower pane and select the new data view from the pop up list. &#x20;

To delete a data view, click the check box to the left of the data view name and then click the trash can to the right to delete it.  You will see a warning message and will need to click 'OK' to delete.

To update a data block associated with a data view, click the blue edit pencil to the right of the data view name.  This will open a pop up window with the data block name and version currently associated with that data view.  In the example below, the 'account\_view' data view is currently in the workset with the data block 'accounts 1.0'.  The pop up window shows that the most recent version of the accounts file linked to that data view is 'accounts 1.1'.  Click the check box to the left of the data block name to select it, and then the 'Save' button at the bottom of the pop up to save the selection.

Once the edits are completed, click the 'Save' button in the top pane of the 'Edit Work Set' window to save your changes.
