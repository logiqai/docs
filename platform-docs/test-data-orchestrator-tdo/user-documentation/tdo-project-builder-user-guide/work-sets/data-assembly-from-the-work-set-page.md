# Data Assembly from the Work Set Page

Data Assembly is the result of your Assignment Rules; this is a file that contains the assigned data for each field in your output format (Action) based on the criteria in each row of your coverage matrix as generated by your Business Rules.

Data Assembly can be kicked off from the 'Worksets' page or from the 'Assignment Rules' page.

To start data assembly from the main 'Worksets' page, select the work set you want to use by clicking the blue check mark to the right of the work set name.  The 'data assembly' icon will not be visible on a work set that has not been selected.

The grid icon to the far right of the icons is the 'data assembly' icon.  To start data assembly, click on this icon.  TDO will display a spinner on screen for a few seconds, and then the message that the data assembly request has been sent.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you start data assembly from this page, you will not be presented with the option of changing the work set lock period; the default 15 minute period will be used.
{% endhint %}

Once the data assembly request is sent, the 'Locked by' column will populate with your name and the 'unlock' icon will be present until the 15 minute lock period expires.
