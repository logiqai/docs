# Work Sets

A Work Set defines the Coverage Matrix, Scenario, and Data Views that will be used to generate the output data for your Project.

The work set acts as the master collection for all of the data blocks (files) and rules (coverage matrix) that will both define what the output looks like as well as where the data is selected from.

Worksets can be created, edited, and deleted.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Work Sets must end with '\_workset'.  If you forget to include this in the name, TDO will prompt you to add it when you save the work set.
