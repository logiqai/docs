# Unlocking a Work Set

When the data assembly process is run, the associated work set is locked for a set period of time.  The default time is 15 minutes but can be changed by the user during the data assembly process.

If a work set is locked by another user, you cannot select the work set and cannot run the data assembly process.

{% hint style="info" %}
A work set lock can only be removed by the user who placed the lock, or a user with Admin rights.
{% endhint %}

If the work set is locked, the name of the user who locked it will show in the column labeled 'Locked by' and an unlock icon will show in the icons _if the user viewing the work set window has unlock rights._  The unlock icon will be the second from the right and is a key with a line through it.

To unlock the work set (remove the lock) click on the unlock icon.  The 'Locked by' name will be removed, and a message will show on the screen that the lock was successfully removed.
