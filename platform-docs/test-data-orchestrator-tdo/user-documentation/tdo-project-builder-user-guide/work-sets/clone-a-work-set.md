# Clone a Work Set

If you want to create a copy of your work set, the easiest way is to use the 'Clone Work Set' button on the main work set page.  This is the center button, looking like two stacked papers with a plus sign on them.

If you do not have Admin rights, the trash can icon will not be shown and you will only see 4 icons on the screen below.
{% endhint %}

When you clone a work set, all of the associated objects are cloned with it.  If you have already created data assignment rules, these will be copied as part of the work set cloning process.

Cloning a work set is very useful when you are creating multiple outputs within a project, and they share some data views and assembly rules.  By cloning an existing work set, you do not have to build the new one from scratch but only have to modify the data views and/or assembly rules as needed.

Click on the clone button and the 'Clone Work Set' action window will open.  On the 'Name' line, TDO will populate the current work set name with a unique trailing digit.  In the example below, TDO defaulted to 'new\_build\_workset2'.  You can keep the suggested name, or give it a different name (here, 'new\_test\_workset' was input.)

Once the name is set, click the 'Clone' button to create an exact copy of your workset with a different name.

Once you click on the 'Clone' button, TDO will process the request.  There will be a spinning circle on the screen while the database creates the new copy, and then the work set list will update to show the new work set.
