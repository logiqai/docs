# Other TDO Menu Items

The menu also contains sections for User Maintenance and Help.

If you are an Admin, you will have the options for User Maintenance, LDAP Configuration, and Project Access in this section.

If you have User rights, you will only see the Users section here.  You can reset your own password in this section.

Instructions for these functions are found in the [https://docs.apica.io/platform-docs/test-data-orchestrator-tdo/technical-guides](https://docs.apica.io/platform-docs/test-data-orchestrator-tdo/technical-guides) section of the on line documents.

All of the TDO manuals are on line and the Help section of TDO only contains high level instructions on the Format Functions.
