# Adding, Changing, or Deleting a Determining Attribute Value

Once a determining attribute value has been set, you can edit the priority and the filtering but you cannot edit the value itself.  To change a value, you must delete it from the list and enter the new value separately.

To delete a value from the list, open the ‘Edit Determining Attribute’ window and navigate to the ‘Values’ section.  Click the checkbox to the left of the value, and then click the trash can to the right of the value.  A verification window will pop up asking if you want to delete the value.

Here we are deleting the value ‘SGD’ from the list.  Click ‘OK’ to delete the record.

After you click ‘OK’, the screen now shows only 5 values.

To add a new value to the list, type in the value (and priority, if desired) in the center pane of the Edit window.  Here, we are adding ‘CAN’ as a priority 2 value.  Click the plus (+) sign to the right to add it to the list.  When you are done editing, click the ‘Save’ button at the top of the list to save your changes to the attribute.

You cannot directly change ‘SGD’ to ‘CAN’; you must delete SGD and add CAN as two separate actions.  The sequence that these actions are performed in does not matter.
