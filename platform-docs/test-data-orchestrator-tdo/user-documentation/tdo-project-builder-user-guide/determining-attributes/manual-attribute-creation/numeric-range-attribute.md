# Numeric Range Attribute

To manually create a determining attribute, click the plus (+) sign in the lower right corner of the determining attributes screen. This will open the ‘Create Determining Attribute’ window.

First, give the attribute a name.  This one is called ‘pmt\_amt’ as it represents a randomly selected payment amount.  In the use case we are building, there are three different payment ranges we will be testing – under $250, $250 - $2,500, and $2,500 – 25,000.

In the ‘Type’ section of the upper pane, select ‘Range’.  Since this is a numeric field, select ‘Number’ from the ‘Data Type’ drop down menu.

In the center pane, there are fields for ‘min value’ and ‘max value’.  Enter the values for the first range and click the plus (+) sign to the right to add that to the values list.  In the example below, the first set of values has been added and the second set is entered and ready to add.

After adding all of your value ranges, click the ‘Save’ button in the top pane to save the determining attribute.
