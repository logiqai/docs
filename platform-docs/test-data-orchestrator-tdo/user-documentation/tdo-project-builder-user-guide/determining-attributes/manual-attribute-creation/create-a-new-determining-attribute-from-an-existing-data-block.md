# Create a New Determining Attribute from an Existing Data Block

In some cases, you may need to create a determining attribute from an existing data block.  In the situation shown below, we have already used the ‘currency’ field from the ‘accounts’ data block to create the determining attribute for the account currency.  We still need to create a field for the payment currency value, but since the same currencies are supported for payments we can use the accounts data block as our source instead of manually typing them in.

Open the ‘Create Determining Attributes’ window, name the attribute (pmt\_currency), and select ‘Values’ and ‘String' in the Types/Data Types section.  To the right of the ‘Data Types’ line is a header of ‘Source Attribute’ with a pencil icon.  Click on the pencil icon to open a data block selection window.

When the window pops up, start typing the data block name on the top line. TDO will search for files that match what you are typing. (You can type the full file name, or a partial name – which can be any portion of the file name – and TDO will find all matches for your entered value.) Once you see the list, select your data block. In this case, we want the ‘accounts’ data block. Click on that to open the attributes list.

This will populate a list of all fields in the data block. Click on the field that contains the data values you want to use in the determining attribute. Here, we want to use the ‘currency’ field.

When you click on the desired field name, this will close the popups and show the selected values in the 'Create Determing Attribute' window. Click on the pencil to the right of the ‘Source Data Set’ field to see the list of available unique values in the selected field.

This opens a ‘Choose Values’ popup with all unique values found in the selected field. You can select all of the values by clicking the check box on the top line, or can select only certain values by checking them off individually.

Once you’ve identified the values you want in your attribute (here, we want them all so the top box was checked) scroll down to the bottom of the pop up window and click ‘Save’.&#x20;

Once you’ve completed these actions, you can now see all of your determining attributes in the Determining Attributes list.
