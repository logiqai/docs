# Manual Attribute Creation

If the determining attribute cannot be sourced from an existing data file (i.e., for new functionality) you will need to create the attributes manually.&#x20;

Click the plus (+) sign in the lower right corner of the window to open the ‘Create Determining Attribute’ pane.

This attribute is called ‘channel’ and will be used to designate the source of a payment.  The type is ‘Value’ (since each value is unique) and the data type for this attribute is ‘String’.&#x20;

Since we are creating a ‘Value’ type attribute, there is only one field to complete for each value.  We are using the values of ‘MOBILE’, ‘ONLINE’, and ‘BRANCH’ here to indicate the source (channel) for incoming or outgoing payments in this use case.

As with range creation, once the attribute values are populated, click on the ‘Save’ button to save the attribute to your list of determining attributes.
