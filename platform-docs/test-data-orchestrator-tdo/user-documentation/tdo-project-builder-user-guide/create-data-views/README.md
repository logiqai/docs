# Create Data Views

Data Views are how TDO ‘joins’ the different data blocks containing data to the coverage matrix and to each other.  They are similar to WHERE or JOIN statements in SQL.  Data views are used in the Work Set to identify where data should come from and how it is joined/linked.

To begin, you will need to create a Data View using your Coverage Set/Coverage Matrix.  This is the main data view, as it links to the business rules directly. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Every Work Set must have a Data View linked to the coverage set.
{% endhint %}

It is important that your data views are created in the right sequence - i.e., the file that is serving as the reference/lookup file must have it's view created first.  So the Coverage Set data view is always the first data view created.

Also note that you can use the same file for multiple data views.  This is sometimes needed when using the same values for multiple different lookups.
