# Test Data Orchestrator (TDO)

Test Data Orchestrator (TDO) automates and accelerates Data Provisioning and Test Preparation,  effectively shrinking these traditionally slow and manual activities to enable Continuous Testing.&#x20;

TDO calculates exactly what you need to test, and then generates everything you need to actually test it. This involves calculating optimal test coverage, expressed as a data pattern – in a consumable matrix, and then automating the rest of the testing lifecycle based on these data patterns, including automation of data requests, data generation, calculation of expected results, matching data to tests, generating executable tests and feeding data to tests on demand. TDO then ties in with orchestration tools to enable truly Continuous 8(10) Testing.&#x20;

TDO puts the data in DevOps and enables Continuous Delivery by automating the slowest activities in the testing lifecycle. By shrink-wrapping test data and test preparation Agile teams can now fit robust testing in-Sprint, instead of accumulating Testing Debt – making Testing truly Continuous, and completing automation of the Delivery Pipeline.&#x20;

TDO is provided as an On-Premises software subscription.
