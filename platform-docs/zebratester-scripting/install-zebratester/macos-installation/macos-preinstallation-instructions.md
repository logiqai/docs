# macOS Preinstallation Instructions



### Special Installation Instructions For macOS <a href="#macospreinstallationinstructions-specialinstallationinstructionsformacos" id="macospreinstallationinstructions-specialinstallationinstructionsformacos"></a>

A misinterpretation of a filetype will cause later macOS versions to require you to make one of the installation files executable. Here’s how to do it.

_Note: \[NNA] stands for the ZebraTester version number followed by the letter of that release. So, in the screenshots, in the filename ‘55Z’ stands for Version 5.5Z._

| **Step**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Screenshot**                 |

| <p>After unzipping the installation package there will be a <strong>ZBA[NNA].app</strong> installer file.</p><p>We need to <strong>Right-click</strong> that installer file and select "<em>Show Package Contents</em>"</p>                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                |
| <p>In Finder, go into /Contents/MacOS and find the file “ZBA[NNA]”. Notice that it will be listed as a TextEdit.app document because macOS does not recognize it as part of an installation package. In this state, this will cause the installation to fail.</p><p>We need to take this one file and change its properties to be an executable file.</p>                                                              |                                |
| <p>Open up a Terminal Window.</p><ul><li>Write "chmod -R +x ".</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                |
| <p>From the Finder Window, drag the ZBA[NNA] file to the Terminal, after the line that started with chmod, so the line looks like the following:</p><p><code>chmod -R +x /Users/[username]/[path]/ZBA55Z.app/Contents/MacOS/ZBA[NNA]</code></p><ul><li>Press Enter to make the file executable</li></ul><p> </p>                                                                                                       |                                |
| <p>Now go back to the folder where you unzipped the file.</p><p>Again, <strong>Right-click</strong> that installer file and select "<em>Show Package Contents</em>" and you will now see that the properties have now allowed this to change from a text file to an executable file.</p>                                                                                                                               | <p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p> |
| <p><strong>Pre execution of the Installer file</strong><br>Select the <strong>Open + Command (⌘) key before clicking</strong> and you should get a verification. That indicates this file was not signed with a certificate that Apple recognizes. This is OK.</p><p>Open it to start the installation process continued <a href="https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT/pages/4620832/MacOS+X">here</a>.</p> |                                |
