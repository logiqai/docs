# Execute a JMeter Test Plan in ZebraTester

This feature has not proceeded with recent development and thus might not work to your expectation at times, due to lack of interest from end-users.

A JMeter Test Plan describes a series of steps JMeter will execute when run. A complete test plan will consist of one or more Thread Groups, logic controllers, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements. These test plans are saved as a “.JMX” file and ZebraTester can execute these JMeter test plan files natively.

| In the Project Navigator, upload the .jmx formatted JMeter test plan File.                                                           |                  |
| <p>Execute the Test using the Generate Load Test Icon which will now show “Execute JMeter Script and Generate CSV Report”</p><p></p> |                  |
| The test will execute and there will be a waiting period ad your CSV file of the results gets created.                               |                  |
| Once the CSV Results Report has been Completed, you’ll see the file as well as an icon next to it to download it.                    |                  |
