# Modify Session

The “Modify Session” functionality can be used to pull Items (URLs or Page Breaks) from another saved session and add them to the currently opened session. It not only pulls the ‘Item’ but also brings along any related Variables, Inline script, Input files etc.

**How to use:**

1. You must have a script opened most of the time in order to use ‘Modify Session’ at its best
2. While a recorded session is open, click on ‘Modify session’ button



3\. Select another script within the ‘Modify Recoded Session’ window



4\. Select the URL calls or Page breaks which you want to copy to the opened session



5\. Now select the Index number after which you want to add these Items and click Apply



6\. Enable the new hosts as it might have filtered out if a hosts filter is already applied \[Check if applicable]



7\. You can see that new Items have been added to the existing script and all these Items will have a special symbol next to Item numbers which denotes that its added from another session



8\. Any variables, inline script, input files which was available for any of these URL’s will also get added to the working session
