## How to Execute a JMeter Test Plan in ZebraTester <a href="#advancedtopics-howtoexecuteajmetertestplaninzebratester" id="advancedtopics-howtoexecuteajmetertestplaninzebratester"></a>

A **JMeter Test Plan** describes a series of steps JMeter will execute when run. A complete test plan will consist of one or more Thread Groups, logic controllers, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements. These test plans are saved as a “.JMX” file and ZebraTester can execute these **JMeter Test Plan** files natively.

**JUnit** is an open-source Unit **Testing** Framework for JAVA. It is useful for Java Developers to write and run repeatable **tests**. ... As the name implies, it is used for Unit **Testing** of a small chunk of code. Developers who are following **test**-driven methodology must write and execute unit **tests** first before any code.

ZebraTester supports executing JUnit test cases.
