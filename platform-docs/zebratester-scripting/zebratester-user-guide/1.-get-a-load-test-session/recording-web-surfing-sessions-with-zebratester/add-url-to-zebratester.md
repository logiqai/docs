There may be requirements to add a new page/URL to an existing ZebraTester Scenario.

The Add URL Icon found on the Main Menu Recorded Session Submenu:



This opens up a dialog that allows you to add an HTTP/HTTPS URL call to a URL of your choice, specify the browser and additional parameters that will be sent with the call.



Once that request has been executed, you can review the content returned as well as the headers, body, authorization, and even the cookies before you decide to add the results to an existing recorded session. You can add this content at either the end of the session or at a point that you can specify, with or without a Page Break.
