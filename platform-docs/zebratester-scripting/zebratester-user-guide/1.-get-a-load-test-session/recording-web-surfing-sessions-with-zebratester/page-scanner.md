# Page Scanner



ZebraTester's Page Scanner function browses and explores web pages of a web server automatically in a recursive way - similar to a Web Spider or a Web Crawler.

### Page Scanner's Purpose <a href="#pagescanner-pagescannerspurpose" id="pagescanner-pagescannerspurpose"></a>

**Primary**: To turn a "normal" web surfing session into a load test program. This provides a simplified way to create a web surfing session instead of recording single web pages manually.

_However, Page Scanner can only be used to acquire web surfing sessions that do not require HTML form-based authentication. This tool is not a replacement for recording web surfing sessions of real web applications._

**Other**: Page Scanner allows the detection of broken links inside a website and provides statistical data about the largest and slowest web pages. It also supports searching for text fragments overall scanned web pages.

**Note 1:** Page Scanner does not interpret JavaScript code and does not submit forms. Only hyperlinks are considered. Cookies are automatically supported.

**Note 2:** Page Scanner keeps the entire scanned website in its transient memory (RAM) in compressed form. This means that large websites can be scanned, but it also means that transient memory is not unlimited.

Please note that the Page Scanner tool may return no result or return an incomplete result because some websites or web pages contain malformed HTML code or because old, unusual HTML options have been used within the scanned web pages. Although this tool has been intensively tested, we cannot provide any warranty for error-free behavior. Possible website--or webpage-related errors--may be impossible to fix because of divergent requirements or complexity. The functionality and behavior are similar to other search engines, which also have similar restrictions.

### GUI Display <a href="#pagescanner-guidisplay" id="pagescanner-guidisplay"></a>



The window is divided into two parts.

| **Scan Result**: The upper part of the window shows the scan's progress or the scan results when it has been completed. |   |

| **Page Scanner Input Parameter**: The lower part of the window allows scan input parameters and starting a scan.        |   |

#### Page Scanner Parameter Inputs <a href="#pagescanner-pagescannerparameterinputs" id="pagescanner-pagescannerparameterinputs"></a>

| `Starting Web Page`                                                                       | The scan starts from this URL. Optionally, scan only parts of a website by entering a deep-linked URL path; for example, `http://www.example.com/sales/customers.html`. In this case, only web pages below or at the same level of the URL path are scanned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Char Encoding`                                                                           | The default value, `Auto Detect`, can be overridden in case some or all web pages are wrongly coded, such that the HTML header-specified character set does not match the character set which is actually used within the HTML body of the web pages (malformed HTML at server-side). You can try `ISO-8859-1` or `UTF`as a workaround if Page Scanner cannot extract hyperlinks (succeeding web pages) from the starting web page.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Exclude Path Patterns`                                                                   | Excludes one or more URL path patterns from scanning. Commas separate the path patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Follow Web Servers`                                                                      | Include content and web pages from other web servers within the scan; for example, images embedded in the web pages located on another web server. Enter several additional web servers, separated by commas. Example: `http://www.example.com`, `https://imgsrv.example.com:444`. The protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), the hostname (usually www), the domain, and the TCP/IP port are considered, but URL paths are NOT considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Verify External Links`                                                                   | Verify all external links to all other web servers. This is commonly used to detect broken hyperlinks to other web servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Include`                                                                                 | Effects which sets of embedded content types should also be included in the scan. Page Scanner uses the URL paths' file extensions to determine the content type (if available) because this can be done before the hyperlink of the embedded content itself is processed. This saves execution time, but it might affect a few URLs for excluded content types that flow into the result from scanning because the MIME type of the received HTTP response headers is only used in detecting web pages. Remove these unwanted URLs after the scan has been completed using the "remove URL" form in the Display Result window. |

| **Scan Result per Web Page:** displays all scanned web pages. A web page's embedded content, such as images, is always displayed in a **Web Browser Cached View.** For example, this can mean that a particular (unique) image is only shown once inside the web page in which it has been referenced for the first time. All subsequent web pages will not show the same embedded content. This behavior is more or less equal to what a web browser does - it caches duplicate references over all the web pages within a web surfing session.                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
