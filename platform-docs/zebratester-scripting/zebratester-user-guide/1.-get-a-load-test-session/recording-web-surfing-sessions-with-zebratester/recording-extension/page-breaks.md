# Page Breaks

Page breaks are an excellent way to organize the steps in your web recording and the generated script.

### Introduction <a href="#pagebreaks-introduction" id="pagebreaks-introduction"></a>

In Web Session recordings, a page break is a separator entered into a recording to discern different pages (which typically consist of multiple URL calls) from each other.

Page breaks are used to provide reasonable divisions in the page flow, typically by adding a page break before each step of a workflow utilizing multiple web pages in a site.

| Start in a running recording:                                                                                                                                    |   |

| <p>To add a page break in the browser extension:</p><ul><li>Enter a <strong>Page Break Name</strong></li><li>Click  <strong>Insert Page Break</strong></li></ul> |   |
| The page break is inserted into the recording:                                                                                                                   |   |
