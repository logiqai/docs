# Recording Extension Introduction

The Apica Recorder Extension allows you to record web surfing sessions in your browser and is available for Firefox, Version 60 and up, and Chrome, Versions 66 and up.

Once installed, start ZebraTester Console, then click on the Help button inside the Apica Script Recorder extension and follow the instructions.

**Note: Using the Firefox or Chrome extensions is optional – Web surfing sessions can also be recorded without using either of these extensions. See the ZebraTester User’s Guide, Chapter 2, to learn how to record Web surfing sessions with any other Web browser such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or Safari.**

**Note Too** You need to have the ZebraTester console installed and running. The extension will then provide an interface to perform recordings of web sessions. For more information, see the [ZebraTester Online documentation](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT).

To use the extension:



* Start the ZebraTester Console
* Open the application you want to record in the browser
* Start the recording, using the black and white menu icon to access the dropdown menu&#x20;

ZebraTester is automatically set as a web proxy during the recording.

You can choose to empty the browser cache before recording.

* Record tasks in the application:
  * Add a Page Break to separate the events into logical chunks
  * Perform the actions you want to record in the application
  * Repeat adding pages and performing tasks as needed
* Stop the recording

The recorded events are now available in the ZebraTester GUI where you can work with the script further.
