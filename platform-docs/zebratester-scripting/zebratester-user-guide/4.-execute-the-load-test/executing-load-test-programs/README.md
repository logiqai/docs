## Introduction <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-introduction" id="executingloadtestprograms-introduction"></a>

Executing a Load Test is started in the Project Navigator. The icon to the right of the \*.class files will have a red arrow.

***

The icon to the right of the Job Template (\*.xml) files will have a green arrow and will directly open a Start Load Test Job, which is covered [here towards the end of this page](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT/pages/28344346/Executing+Load+Test+Programs#Rerunning-Load-Tests-Jobs-\(Job-Templates\))).

## Load Test (\*.class) files. <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-loadtest-.class-files" id="executingloadtestprograms-loadtest-.class-files"></a>



## Execute Load Test Steps in the Project Navigator <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-executeloadteststepsintheprojectnavigator" id="executingloadtestprograms-executeloadteststepsintheprojectnavigator"></a>

After the Project Navigator has called the load test program, you must enter the test input parameters for the test run (a single execution of the load test program is also called “test run”).



The most important parameters are the **Number of Concurrent Users** and **Load Test Duration.** For short-duration Load Tests, Apica recommends 100% URL sampling. We also recommend entering a small comment about the test run into the **Annotation** input field.

| <p><strong>Additional Options</strong></p><p>Several additional options for executing the load test can be combined by adding a blank character between each of the options. The following additional options can be configured.</p>                                                                 | <p><strong>-multihomed</strong><br>Initiates all Exec Agents to use multiple local IP addresses when executing a load test. This option allows simulating traffic from more than one IP address per Exec Agent. This option is only considered if the Exec Agent supports a multihomed network configuration (several IP addresses assigned to the same host). The first step to use this option is to configure the Windows or Unix operating system multiple IP addresses for the same host. The second step is to assign these IP addresses to the Exec Agent configuration. For the localhost, where the Web Admin GUI is running, the second step can be done by calling the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7990/dfischer/webadmininterface/htdocs/helpProjectNavigatorJavaSetup.html">Setup</a> menu inside the Project Navigator (gear-wheel icon at the top navigation). For remote Exec Agents, you have to edit the file <strong>javaSetup.dat,</strong> located inside the ZebraTester installation directory - by modifying the entry value <strong>javaVirtualIpAddresses</strong>: enter all IP addresses of the host on the same line, separated by comma characters.<br>This option's effect is that each concurrent user uses its own client IP address during the load test. If fewer IP addresses are available than concurrent users are running, the IP addresses are averaged across the users.<br><br><strong>-ipperloop</strong><br>Using this option combined with the option -multihomed effects that an owned local IP address is used for each executed loop rather than for each simulated user.<br>This option is considered only if also the option -multihomed is used.<br><br><strong>-tconnect &#x3C;seconds></strong><br>Set a timeout in seconds to open a TCP/IP socket connection to the Web server. If the time is exceeded, the URL call is aborted and marked as failed. Note that the value must be greater than zero but should be less than "Request Timeout per URL."<br><br><strong>-dnshosts &#x3C;file-name></strong><br>Effects: The load test job uses an own DNS hosts file to resolve hostnames rather than the underlying operating system's hosts file.<br>Note that you have to ZIP the hosts file together with the compiled class of the script. To automate the ZIP, it's recommended to declare the hosts file as an <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7990/dfischer/webadmininterface/htdocs/helpDeclareExternalResources.html">external resource</a> (w/o adding it to the CLASSPATH).<br><br><strong>-dnstranslation &#x3C;file-name></strong><br>Effects: The load test job uses a DNS translation file, a text file containing a translation between two DNS names. If the first DNS name in the file matches the DNS name passed to the resolver, then the second DNS name is used to resolve the IP address.<br>The first DNS name can also contain one or more wildcard characters ('*' = wildcard for multiple characters, ‘?' = wildcard for a single character). Lines or a part of a line can be commented on using the hash char '#.’</p><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: It could be needed that TLS SNI (Server Name Indication) must be disabled if a DNS translation table is used.</p><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: The HTTP request header field "Host" is not updated, so that you could call the Web server with the wrong hostname.<br>You have to ZIP the DNS translation file together with the compiled class of the script. To automate the ZIP, it's recommended to declare the DNS translation file as an <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7990/dfischer/webadmininterface/htdocs/helpDeclareExternalResources.html">external resource</a> (w/o adding it to the CLASSPATH).</p><p><strong>-dnssrv &#x3C;IP-name-server-1>[,&#x3C;IP-name-server-N>]</strong><br>Effects that the load test job uses specific (own) DNS server(s) to resolve hostnames - rather than to use the DNS library of the underlying operating system.<br>When using this option, at least one IP address of a DNS server must be specified. Multiple DNS servers can be configured separated by commas. If a resolved DNS hostname contains multiple IP addresses, the stressed Web servers are called in a round-robin order (user 1 uses resolved IP Address no. 1, user 2 uses resolved IP Address no. 2, etc.).<br><br><strong>-dnsenattl</strong><br>Enable consideration of DNS TTL by using the received TTL-values from the DNS server(s).<br>This option cannot be used in combination with the option -dnsperloop.<br>Note: when using this option, the resolved IP addresses (and therefore the stressed Web servers) may alter inside the executed loop of a simulated user at any time - suddenly from one URL call to the next one.<br><br><strong>-dnsfixttl &#x3C;seconds></strong><br>Enable DNS TTL by using a fixed TTL-value of seconds for all DNS resolves. This option cannot be used in combination with the option.</p><p><strong>-dnsperloop</strong><br>Perform new DNS resolves for each executed loop. All resolves are stable within the same loop (no consideration of DNS TTL within a loop).<br>This option cannot be used in combination with the options -dnsenattl or -dnsfixttl.<br>Note: consider when using this option that the default or the configured DNS servers are stressed more than usual because each simulated user's executed loop will trigger one or more DNS queries.<br><br><strong>-dnsstatistic</strong><br>Effects that statistical data about DNS resolutions are measured and displayed in the load test result using a DNS stack on the load generators.<br>Note: there is no need to use this option if any other, more specific DNS option is enabled because all (other) DNS options also effect implicitly that statistical data about DNS resolutions are measured. If you use this option without any other DNS option, the (own) DNS stack on the load generators will communicate with the default configured DNS servers of the operating system - but without considering the "hosts" file.<br><br><strong>-dnsdebug</strong><br>Effects that debug information about the DNS cache and DNS resolves are written to the stdout file (*.out) of the load test job.<br><br><strong>-enableIPv6 [&#x3C;network-interface-name>]</strong><br>Enable IPv6 support only for load test execution (IPv4 disabled). Optionally you also can provide the IPv6 network interface name of the load generators(s), like "eno," for example.<br><br><strong>-enableIPv6v4 [&#x3C;network-interface-name>]</strong><br>Enable IPv6 and IPv4 support for load test execution (first will try with IPv6, if fails, will try with IPv4). Optionally you also can provide the IPv6 network interface name of the load generators(s), like "eno," for example.<br><br><strong>-mtpu &#x3C;number></strong><br>Allows configuring how many threads per simulated user are used to process URLs in parallel (simultaneously). Note: This value applies only to URLs that have been configured to be executed in parallel.<br><br><strong>-nosdelayCluster</strong><br>Effects for Cluster Jobs that the <strong>Startup Delay per User</strong> is applied per Exec Agent Job instead of applying it overall simulated users of the Cluster Job. Thus a faster ramp-up of load can be achieved.<br><br><strong>-setuseragent "&#x3C;text>"</strong><br>Replaces the recorded value of the HTTP request header field User-Agent with a new value. The new value is applied for all executed URL calls.<br><br><strong>-noECC</strong><br>Disable elliptic curves (ECC).<br><br><strong>-sslcache &#x3C;seconds></strong><br>Alters the timeout of the user-related SSL cache. The default value is 300 seconds. A value of 0 (zero) affects that the SSL cache is disabled.<br><br><strong>-sslrandom &#x3C;type></strong><br>Set the type of random generator used for SSL handshakes. Possible options are "fast", "iaik" (default) or "java".<br><br><strong>-sslcmode</strong><br>Apply SSL/HTTPS compatibility workarounds for deficient SSL servers. You may try this option if you constantly get the error type "Network Connection aborted by Server" for all URL calls.<br><br><strong>-nosni</strong><br>Disable support for TLS server name indication (SNI).<br><br><strong>-snicritical</strong><br>Set the TLS SNI extension as critical (default: non-critical).<br><br><strong>-tlssessiontickets</strong><br>Set the TLS to use Session Tickets for session resuming (non-critical).<br><br><strong>-iaikLast</strong><br>Adds the IAIK security provider at the last position (instead of the default: IAIK at first position).<br>Note: Adding the IAIK security provider at the last position may have the side effect that weak or short cipher keys are used.<br><br><strong>-tz &#x3C;timezone></strong><br>Sets an alternatively time zone which is used by the script. The default time zone is equal to the selection made when installing ZebraTester, or - if modified subsequently - which has been set in the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7990/dfischer/webadmininterface/htdocs/helpPersonalSettings.html">Personal Settings</a> menu. Possible time zone values are described in chapter 6 of the Application Reference Manual.<br><br><strong>-Xbootclasspath/a:&#x3C;path></strong><br>Specify for the load test job a path of JAR archives and ZIP archives to append to the default bootstrap classpath.<br><br><strong>-Xbootclasspath/p:&#x3C;path></strong><br>Specify for the load test job a path of JAR archives and ZIP archives to prepend in front of the default bootstrap classpath.<br><br><strong>-Xmx&#x3C;megabytes></strong><br>Specify for the load test job the size of the Java memory in megabytes. Do not enter a space or a colon between the "-Xmx" and the value.<br>Note: this option can only be used if the corresponding Exec Agent(s) supports this option, meaning that the Exec Agent(s) is started with the option -enableJobOverrideJavaMemory.<br><br><strong>-nostdoutlog</strong><br>Disable to write any data to the stdout file of the load test job.</p> |

### Starting Exec Agent Jobs <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-startingexecagentjobs" id="executingloadtestprograms-startingexecagentjobs"></a>

If you have specified that a single Exec Agent executes the load test program (but not by an Exec Agent Cluster), the load test program is transmitted to the local or remote Exec Agent, and a corresponding load test job - with a job number - is created locally within the Exec Agent. The job is now in the state “**configured**”; that is, ready to run, but the job is not yet started.



&#x20;**Hint:** each Exec Agent always executes load test jobs as separate background processes and can execute **more than one job at the same time**. The option **Display Real-Time Statistic** only means that the GUI opens an additional network connection to the Exec Agent, which reads the real-time data directly from the corresponding executed load test program's memory space.

* Click the **Start Load Test Job** button to start the job.

If you have de-selected the checkbox **Display Real-Time Statistic**, the window will close after a few seconds; however, you can - at any time - access the real-time statistic data, or the result data, of the job by using the **Jobs** menu, which can be called from the Main Menu and also from the Project Navigator.

Alternatively, the load test program can also be **scheduled** to be executed at a predefined time. However, the corresponding Exec Agent process must be available (running) at the predefined time because the scheduling entry is stored locally inside the Exec Agent jobs working directory, which the Exec Agent itself monitors. Especially if you have started the local Exec Agent implicitly by using the **ZebraTester Console** - AND if the scheduled job should run on that local Exec Agent, you must keep the ZebraTester Console Window open so that the job will be started ¹.

¹ This restriction can be avoided by installing the Exec Agent as a Windows Service or as a Unix Daemon (see Application Reference Manual).

**Note:** if you close the window without clicking on the **Start Load Test Job** button, the job remains in the state "configured" or “scheduled.” Afterward, you can use the **Load Test Jobs** menu to start or delete the job or schedule or cancel this job schedule.

### Real-Time Job Statistics (Exec Agent Jobs) <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-real-timejobstatistics-execagentjobs" id="executingloadtestprograms-real-timejobstatistics-execagentjobs"></a>



Real-time statistics shown in this window are updated every 5 seconds for as long as the load test job is running.

**Note:** **closing this window will&#x20;**_**not stop**_**&#x20;the load test job**. If you close this window, you can later acquire the load test result or return to this dialogue (if the load test is still running) by clicking on the **Jobs icon** in the Main Menu or the Project Navigator window.

You may **abort** a running load test job by clicking on the **Job Actions** button, which includes.

* Abort Job: Aborting a job will take a few seconds because the job writes out the statistic result file (`*.prxres`) before it terminates.
* Suspend Job
* Increase Users
* Decrease Users
* Abort Increase/Decrease Users
* Extend Test Duration
* Reduce Test Duration

The most relevant measured values of the URLs are shown for the selected page by clicking on the page's magnifier icon.

* Using this menu, you can also display and analyze **error snapshots** by clicking on the magnifier icon next to the failure counter. In this way, you can begin analyzing errors immediately as they occur - during the running load test.
* By clicking on a URL, the corresponding **URL Response Time Diagram** is shown.

All of these detailed data, including all error data, are also stored inside the final result file (`.prxres`), which can be accessed when the load test job has been completed.

### Response Time Overview Diagrams (Real-Time) <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-responsetimeoverviewdiagrams-real-time" id="executingloadtestprograms-responsetimeoverviewdiagrams-real-time"></a>



**Description:** displays during the load test (at real-time) a diagram per web page about the measured response times.

Please consider that maybe only a fraction of the response times are shown, depending on the **Additional Sampling Rate per Page Call,** which was selected when the load test was started. For example, only every fifth response time is shown if the **Additional Sampling Rate per Page Call** was set to 20%.

**Input Fields**

| `Response Time (drop-down list)` | Allows to select the period, from the current time back to the past, are shown in the diagrams within the response times.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Time Bars (drop-down list)`     | Allows selecting if the bars inside the diagrams are shown as average values or as max. values. Please note that there is only a difference between the max. values and the average values if multiple measured samples of the response time fall inside the same pixel (inside the same displayed bar):. |

**URL Errors / Real-Time Profile of Error Types:** This diagram shows an overview of what kind of errors did occur for the URL at which time, measured since the load test was started. This "basic error information" is always "accurately" measured independently of the value chosen for the "Additional Sampling Rate per URL Call" - and **captured in every case**, also if no more memory is left to store full error snapshots.

### Error Overview Diagrams (Real-Time) <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-erroroverviewdiagrams-real-time" id="executingloadtestprograms-erroroverviewdiagrams-real-time"></a>



**Description:** Displays during the load test (at real-time) an overview of all occurred errors.



**Failure Diagrams:** The first diagram shows an overview of what kind of errors did occur, counted overall URLs, and measured since the load test was started. **This "basic error information" is always captured in every case**, also if no more memory is left to store full error snapshots.

The succeeding diagrams, shown per web page, provide only information at which time errors occurred. The tables on the right side of the diagrams show the number of errors that did occur on the URLs of the web page. You can click on an error counter to show the error detail information (error snapshots) for the corresponding URL. **First Error Snapshots:** Displays a list of errors at first (at the start of the load test). By clicking on a magnifier icon, the corresponding error detail information (error snapshot) is shown.

**Latest Error Snapshots:** Displays a list of the latest (newest) errors. By clicking on a magnifier icon, the corresponding error detail information (error snapshot) is shown.



#### Input Fields <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-inputfields.2" id="executingloadtestprograms-inputfields.2"></a>

| `All failed URL Calls`  | effects that all errors about failed URL calls are shown (non-fatal and fatal errors). |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Session Failures only` | effects that only fatal errors about failed URL calls are shown (session failures).    |



**Error Snapshot Memory: % used +**: By clicking on the **+** (plus sign), you can increase the amount of memory available to store error snapshots. Please **Note:** when the memory is already 50% or more used, **no additional error snapshots for non-fatal errors** are captured. This means that increasing the memory may also re-enable capturing for non-fatal errors.

### Statistical Overview Diagrams (Real-Time) <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-statisticaloverviewdiagrams-real-time" id="executingloadtestprograms-statisticaloverviewdiagrams-real-time"></a>



**Description:** displays statistical overview diagrams (in real-time) about a load test job.

Note: The values shown in the diagrams are captured at regular intervals, depending on the Statistic Sampling Interval, which was selected when the load test was started.

| `Concurrent Users`                 | The total number of simulated users.                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Users Waiting For Response`       | The number of users who are waiting for a response from the webserver.                                                                                                 |
| `Session Failures`                 | The number of failed sessions - which is the same as the number of fatal errors.                                                                                       |
| `Session Time per User - per Loop` | The session time for one loop per simulated user. This value is the sum of "the response time of all URLs and all user's think times" per successfully completed loop. |
| `Web Transaction Rate`             | The number of (successful) completed URL calls per second measured overall simulated users.                                                                            |

| `TCP Socket Connect Time`          | The time in milliseconds (per URL call) to open a new network connection to the webserver.                                                                             |
| `Network Throughput`               | The total network traffic which is generated by this load test job, measured in megabits per second.                                                                   |

**Real-Time Comments**

**Description:** supports entering comments during the load test execution.

Real-time comments are notes or Tips, which you can enter during the load test execution:



These comments are later displayed inside all time-based diagrams of the load test result detail menu :





You can also **modify, delete or add real-time comments** before you generate the PDF report. However, all _retroactively_ entered real-time comments are not permanently stored inside the result data.

### Loading the Statistics File <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-loadingthestatisticsfile" id="executingloadtestprograms-loadingthestatisticsfile"></a>



After the load test job has been completed, the statistic results file (\*.prxres) is stored in the local or remote Exec Agent's job directory. To access this results file, you must transfer it back to the (local) Project Navigator directory from which the load test program was started.

This menu shows all the load test files' files; however, only the statistics results file is usually needed, and this is already selected. The "\*.out" file contains debug information, and the "\*.err" file is either empty or contains internal error messages from the load test program itself.

By clicking on the **Acquire Selected Files** button, all selected files are transferred (back) to the (local) Project Navigator directory.

If the checkbox **Load \*.prxres File on Analyze Load Test Menu** is selected, the statistics results file is also loaded into the memory area of the **Analyze Load Tests** menu, where the statistics and diagrams of the measured data can be shown, analyzed, and compared with results of previous test runs.

## Starting Cluster Jobs <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-startingclusterjobs" id="executingloadtestprograms-startingclusterjobs"></a>

If you have specified that an Exec Agent Cluster executes the load test program, the load test program is transmitted to the _local cluster job controller,_ coordinating all cluster members (Exec Agents). The cluster job controller creates a cluster job and allocates a cluster job number. The cluster job is now in the state “configured” (ready to run, but not yet started).



The number of concurrent users will be automatically distributed across the cluster members, depending on the individual computer systems' capability - called "load factor."

If the load test program uses Input Files, you are asked for each Input File - if you wish **to split the Input File content**. This can be useful, for example, if the Input File contains user accounts (usernames/passwords) but the web application does not allow duplicate logins. In this case, each cluster member must use different user accounts. By clicking on the corresponding magnifier icon, you can view how the Input File data would be distributed across the cluster members. If you do not use the split functionality, each cluster member will receive an entire Input File copy.

The distribution of users across the cluster members can also be modified manually; however, this is useful only if a cluster member is unavailable (marked with light red background). The cluster job can not be started. In this case, you can assign the unavailable cluster member users to other cluster members and then try to start the cluster job again. This redistribution may take a few seconds to complete.

Alternatively, the load test program can also be **scheduled** to be executed at a predefined time. However, the local Job Controller process must be available (running) at the predefined time because the scheduling entry for the cluster job is stored inside the Job Controller working directory, which the Job Controller itself monitors. If you have started the Job Controller implicitly by using the ZebraTester Console, you must keep the ZebraTester Console Window open so that the cluster job will be started ¹. ¹ This restriction can be avoided by installing the local Job Controller as a Windows Service or as a Unix Daemon.

After the cluster job has been scheduled, you can leave this menu by closing the window, and you can use later the **Jobs menu** to cancel or modify the schedule of this job.

### Real-Time Cluster Job Statistics <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-real-timeclusterjobstatistics" id="executingloadtestprograms-real-timeclusterjobstatistics"></a>

The real-time statistics of a cluster job show the most important measured values, similar to the values shown in the Real-Time Statistic of Exec Agent Jobs. The cluster job itself contains Exec Agent jobs that the local cluster job controller has created. By clicking on a cluster member's magnifier icon, the corresponding Exec Agent job's real-time statistics can be displayed in its own window.



If you want to **abort the cluster job**, you must do it at this level, as this will also abort all Exec Agent jobs. Aborting a single Exec Agent job will not interrupt the cluster job.

The same applies to the statistics result file (**\*.prxres**), which **must be accessed at&#x20;**_**this**_**&#x20;level**.

### Loading the Statistics File of Cluster Jobs <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-loadingthestatisticsfileofclusterjobs" id="executingloadtestprograms-loadingthestatisticsfileofclusterjobs"></a>

The statistics results file of a cluster job contains the consolidated (merged) measurements for all cluster members. The calculations for merging the results are extensive; therefore, it may take up to 60 seconds to show the result file. The individual measurements of the Exec Agents are embedded separately inside the same consolidated result file.



The consolidated statistics results file is marked with a grey/blue background and is already selected for you, depending on your ZebraTester version.

Click on the Acquire Selected Files button to get you to the Load Test job's associated files.

By clicking on the magnifier icon, you can access the "\*.out" and "\*.err" files of the corresponding Exec Agent jobs.



Usually, you would work inside the **Analyze Load Tests** menu with the consolidated measurement results _only_. However, it is also possible to expand the measurement results to access the results of each Exec Agent job:



This feature can be used to check if all cluster members have measured approximately the same response times; however, variations in a range of ± 20% or more may be normal:

## Load Test Jobs Menu <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-loadtestjobsmenu" id="executingloadtestprograms-loadtestjobsmenu"></a>



All load test programs started from the Project Navigator are always executed as "batch jobs" by an (external) **Exec Agent** process or by an **Exec Agent Cluster**. This means that it is not required to wait for the completion of a load test program on the “Execute Load Test” window: you can close the "Execute Load Test" window at any time, and you can check later the result, or the actual effort, of all load test jobs by using this menu.

If a load test job has been completed, you will acquire the corresponding statistic result file (`*.prxres`). If a load test job is still running, you are disposed to the job's temporary live-statistic window.

To automate the ZIP, it's recommended to declare the hosts file as an external resource (w/o adding it to the CLASSPATH).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `dnssrv <IP-name-server-1>[,<IP-name-server-N>]` | Effects that the load test job uses specific (own) DNS server(s) to resolve hostnames – rather than to use the DNS library of the underlying operating system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Scripting Load Test Jobs <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-scriptingloadtestjobs" id="executingloadtestprograms-scriptingloadtestjobs"></a>

Several load test jobs can be started from the GUI at the same time. However, the GUI does not have the ability to automatically run sequences of load test jobs, synchronize load test jobs, or automatically start several jobs with a single mouse click.

To perform these kinds of activities, you must program load test job scripts written in the “natural” scripting language of your operating system (Windows: \*.bat files, Unix: \*.sh, \*.ksh, \*.csh … files). Inside these scripts, the **PrxJob** utility is used as the interface to the ZebraTester system. When the Windows version of ZebraTester is installed, the installation kit creates the directory **ScriptExamples** within the Project Navigator, and this directory contains some example scripts.

The **PrxJob** utility allows you to start load test jobs on the local as well as on a remote system. It also provides the capability to create cluster jobs, synchronize jobs, obtain the current state of jobs, and acquire the statistics result files of jobs. More information about the **PrxJob** utility can be found in the **Application Reference Manual, Chapter 4**.

## Rerunning Load Tests Jobs (Job Templates) <a href="#executingloadtestprograms-rerunningloadtestsjobs-jobtemplates" id="executingloadtestprograms-rerunningloadtestsjobs-jobtemplates"></a>

Whenever a load test is started, an additional job definition template file is stored in the actual Project Navigator directory (in XML format). Such a job definition template file contains all configuration data needed to rerun the same load test job.



If you click the **corresponding** button of a job definition template (XML) file in Project Navigator, the load test job, inclusive of all of its input parameters, is automatically transferred to the Exec Agent or the Exec Agent Cluster and immediately ready-to-run.

In the screenshot below, the job was preconfigured to run from a cluster of defined servers with a predefined set of [Load Test Program Arguments](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAZT/pages/28344346/Executing+Load+Test+Programs#Load-Test-Program-Arguments).



Additionally, if you wish to trigger several load test jobs simultaneously to be ready-to-run (by using only one mouse click), you can zip several templates to one zip archive. After this, click the **corresponding** button of the zip archive:
