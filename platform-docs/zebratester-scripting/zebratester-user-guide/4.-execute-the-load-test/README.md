# 4. Execute the Load Test

This category is all about creating/generating the Load Test itself and then executing it on an agent, watching the Load Test progress for real-time analysis and interacting with the test, as it occurs.

This phase also includes getting the post-execution Load Test results and then how to deploy/upload the tests to the Apica Load Test (ALT) portal to execute that test on the Apica platform or to deploy the script to the Apica Synthetic Monitoring (ASM) portal to turn this load test into a long term monitoring script.
