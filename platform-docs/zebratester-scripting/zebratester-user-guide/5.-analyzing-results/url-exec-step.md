# URL Exec Step

**The internal execution step** of the failed URL call will have a value assigned as the “URL Exec Step.” This value reflects the internal processing state of the URL call, captured at the point in time when the error has occurred.

Possible states are:

| Internal Processing State of URL Call | Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
