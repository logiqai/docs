# Performance Overview

This menu option displays a summary of the performance data of the test runs.



The following measured values are shown in the “Performance Overview” Table:

| `Passed / Failed Loops`                  | the total number of passed/failed loops of the test run.                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Average Session Time per Loop`          | average time of a loop, calculated over all simulated users and loops.              |
| `Average Response Time per Page`         | average response time per web page, calculated over all the web pages.              |
| `Web Transaction Rate (Hits per Second)` | the number of successfully-executed URL calls per second.                           |
| `Average Outstanding Requests`           | average of outstanding HTTP/S Requests, executed at exactly the same point in time. |
| `Total HTTP/S Calls`                     | the sum of all by the test run executed HTTP/S calls.                               |
| `HTTP Keep-Alive Efficiency`             | percentage of re-used network connections.                                          |
| `SSL Session Cache Efficiency`           | percentage of abbreviated SSL handshakes.                                           |
| `Average TCP Socket Connect Time`        | average time per URL to open a new network connection to the webserver.             |
| `Average Network Throughput`             | average network traffic, released by the test run.                                  |
| `Total Transmitted Bytes`                | total data volume which was transferred during the test run.                        |
