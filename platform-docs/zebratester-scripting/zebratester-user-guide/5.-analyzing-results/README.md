# 5. Analyzing Results

Measurement results can be analyzed using the **Analyze Load Tests** menu, into which the statistics result files can be loaded.

### Analyzing Measurement Results <a href="#id-5.analyzingresults-analyzingmeasurementresults" id="id-5.analyzingresults-analyzingmeasurementresults"></a>

Loading result files occurs either implicitly during the acquisition of the job statistics result file (this file is also stored inside the Project Navigator directory), or explicitly by clicking on **the corresponding** Analyze Test Results icon of a statistics result file within the Project Navigator.

The loaded data inside the **Analyze Load Tests** menu are stored inside a **volatile memory cache**; therefore, if you delete some results here, they will only be removed from the memory cache, but the **corresponding files inside the Project Navigator will not be deleted**.



You can also invoke this menu from the main menu, and from the Project Navigator, without loading result files.
