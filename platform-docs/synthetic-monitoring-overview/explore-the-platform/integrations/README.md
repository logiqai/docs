# Integrations

The ASM platform is designed to easily integrate with various integration options to better streamline the user experience. These integration options allow you to configure other services within Apica which will enhance your team’s ability to gain insight into application performance.

Integrations can best be divided into four distinct categories - see the “Use Case Overview” section below:

1. Monitoring
2. Notification
3. Access Management
4. Content delivery

To access available integration options, hover over the “Integrations” item on the top level toolbar:

* The data from each integration can be compared to the check results.

**Caveat**: each of the following integration directions was based on the UI when it was written. The UIs may change by the time you read this, so _UI updates are beyond the scope of these articles_. Please go to the integration target sites for their latest information on integration directions.
