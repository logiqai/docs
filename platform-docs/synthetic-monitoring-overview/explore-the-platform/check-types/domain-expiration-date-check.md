# Domain Expiration Date Check

The **DNS Expiration** check returns a different [severity](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/4632179/S+Severity) depending on how many days are left on the registration for the domain. Use the **Domain Expiration** check to determine how many days are left before the domain registration expires.





It will issue a Warning when there are 30 days or fewer left before the expiration date, an Error when there are 7 or fewer days left, and a Fatal on or after the date of expiration.

Every domain costs a small amount of money to own each year which is paid to the registrars. When a domain is initially created, you apply an administrative, technical, and billing contact to the domain.

Many registrars will only send the invoice for renewing your domain subscription via email to the billing contact. If this contact information is outdated, the invoice might disappear and wonâ€™t get paid.

With this check, you will get alerted in time to take steps to locate and pay the bill, and the domain does not disappear from the name servers.
