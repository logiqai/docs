# Metrics

Displaying check metrics in an easy-to-consume fashion is one of the primary focuses of the ASM platform. When monitoring teams use Apica to analyze Metrics, they will often do so at the check level. However, it is also possible to compare the metrics of multiple checks by using the Analyze Metrics feature or by using Apica Panels to view metrics within Grafana. This function includes the following key aspects:

* Analyze Metrics
* Result Values
* Health & Events
* Trends
