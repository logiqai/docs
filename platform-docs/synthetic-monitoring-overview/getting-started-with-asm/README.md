### Dashboard

See [Dashboards](../explore-the-platform/dashboards.md) for more information.

### Apica Panels

The “Apica Panels” menu item allows users to view their configured Apica Panels instances. Apica Panels is a feature which allows users to integrate Apica data into Grafana dashboards for easier viewing. The “Apica Panels” menu item contains two sub-items: “Panels” and “About”.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (2).png" alt="" width="287"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

#### Panels

Clicking the “Panels” link will bring you to the Panels page, on which you can see a high level overview of your Panels dashboards and open or delete an individual Panels dashboard.

The default Panels version available in the ASM SaaS portal is called “Apica Panels (v2)”. There are two major versions of Apica Panels; one version is based on Grafana version 4, and the other (Panels v2) is based on Grafana version 8. Apica Panels (v1) is only available to customers who had ASM Panels enabled before the major version change and have a need to maintain their older dashboards.

### Traceroute

The Traceroute tool allows you to easily run a <mark style="color:blue;">**Traceroute**</mark> from any of our Apica <mark style="color:blue;">**Locations**</mark> to any URL or IP address you choose.

### Introduction

The purpose of running a traceroute is to get an indication of which way traffic takes between a source and a destination. Traceroute sends test Packet with TTL values starting at 1. The resulting <mark style="color:blue;">**ICMP Time Exceeded**</mark> messages are used to discover any devices (called "hops") forwarding the packets to the destination. For each hop, the response time is recorded to indicate transmission speed. Any detected failures or packet losses on the way are also the recorder and displayed to give an idea of the transmission quality.

### Configuration

The Traceroute tool configuration is fairly simple.

| **Item**    | **Description**                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Host        | Target destination.                       |
| Location    | Apica Locations to use as starting point. |
| **Execute** | Perform traceroute.                       |

These <mark style="color:blue;">**Traceroute**</mark> settings are used by default and are not configurable:

| **Option**              | **Value**  |   |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | - |
|  Maximum number of hops |  30        |   |
| Wait timeout per hop    | 5 seconds  |   |
| Job execution timeout   | 60 seconds |   |

### Traceroute Results

The results of the traceroute run is shown in the results frame.

The first line shows information about the traceroute configuration:

* Hostname and IP address, the upper limit on hops to try, and size of the test packets.

On each subsequent row, information about each hop is shown:

* Hop Number, hostname and/or IP address for the hop, and the response times for each of the three test packets.

### Messages

The **Messages** view lets you configure system messages to display to Synthetic Monitoring users.
