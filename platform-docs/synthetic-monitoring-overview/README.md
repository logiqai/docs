# Synthetic Monitoring Overview

## Knowing how your applications and APIs perform is critical to your success

When your business and good name depend upon peak digital performance, downtime due to complex digital performance issues is never an option. Apica’s platform ensures you have the highest availability and unmatched digital performance. You can now uphold your service levels by proactively monitoring your most important digital assets from your end-user’s perspective.

## How it works

Apica’s globally distributed load testing and monitoring agents can regularly and programmatically check your business-critical applications, API services, authentication services, certificates, and DNS services (to name a few) for peak performance and service-level compliance. With a varied choice of predefined monitoring and diagnostic checks, you can find what fits your needs, or leverage your own checks and deploy them to the Apica platform. In addition, our platform can support monitoring of legacy desktop applications or applications requiring custom scripting.
