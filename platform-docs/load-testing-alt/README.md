# Load Testing Overview

The Apica Load Test (ALT) solution provides everything necessary to create, test, and analyze the capacity and performance of web and cloud applications. Broadly speaking, ALT can be considered a performance management platform which can be used together with one or several script creation tools. ALT utilizes a stable world-wide network which allows organizations to:

* Know capacity limits for holiday sales, media spikes, product/event announcements, and the unexpected;
* Optimize cloud and hybrid-cloud deployments by selectively scaling component services;
* Proactively address weak points as part of a plan instead of a costly crisis after the fact; and
* Satisfy many more use cases

## The ALT Process <a href="#the-alt-process" id="the-alt-process"></a>

The process of creating and uploading a script within ALT includes the following steps:

1. Script the test (**Script**)
2. Configure the test parameters (**Setup**)
3. Compile the script into a format which can be understood and run by the ALT platform (**Build**)
4. Run the script within the platform (**Run**)
5. Analyze the script results using a feature-rich GUI (**Analyze**)
6. Run reports and distribute to necessary decision makers (**Report**)

## Components of ALT <a href="#components-of-alt" id="components-of-alt"></a>

ALT is a solution consisting of two components, but even though both products are useful by themselves, they should be considered and used as an integrated whole in order to get the most out of load testing. With this integration, scripts and results can be uploaded and downloaded freely between ZebraTester and Apica Load Test:

### 1. Performance Management with the Apica Load Test Portal <a href="#id-1.-performance-management-with-the-apica-load-test-portal" id="id-1.-performance-management-with-the-apica-load-test-portal"></a>

The Apica LoadTest provides everything necessary for you to create, test, and analyze the capacity and performance of your web and cloud applications.

* Managed Infrastructure
* Execution/Scheduling
* Reporting/Analysis
* Collaboration Storage

### 2. Script Creation with ZebraTester <a href="#id-2.-script-creation-with-zebratester" id="id-2.-script-creation-with-zebratester"></a>

Apica ZebraTester is an enterprise-grade load and stress-testing product trusted by some of the world’s largest organizations. It’s also easy to use and get started.

* Create Load Test Scripts
* Debug & Troubleshoot
* Dynamic Logic
* Advanced Functionality
* Convert Scripts

## Third-Party Integrations <a href="#third-party-integrations" id="third-party-integrations"></a>

Apica has a growing list of third-party integrations (e.g. AWS Code Pipeline, TeamCity, Jenkins, Azure DevOps) that are maintained online.

## Use Cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

Apica LoadTest can be used on its own, without ZebraTester scenarios, for many important tasks. However, when ZebraTester is used together with Apica LoadTest, additional benefits are gained:

* Easily create advanced scenarios by using ZebraTester and utilize Apica's network of agents to generate the load.
* Manage all your scenarios within the portal for easier project management.
* Integrate directly with the Apica LoadTest in ZebraTester for easy management of scenarios and results.

### ZebraTester Use Cases <a href="#zebratester-use-cases" id="zebratester-use-cases"></a>

You can use Apica ZebraTester in a standalone mode, running within your own infrastructure or with the Apica LoadTest for advanced features with your team and continuous testing.

#### Working Locally <a href="#working-locally" id="working-locally"></a>

Apica ZebraTester is an enterprise-grade load and stress-testing product trusted by many of the world’s largest organizations. It’s easy to use and get started with load testing by using Apica ZebraTester.

Apica ZebraTester executes web load tests up to nearly unlimited levels at a depth unparalleled by other testing tools. A powerful GUI allows you to create sophisticated, custom load test scripts easily and intuitively.
