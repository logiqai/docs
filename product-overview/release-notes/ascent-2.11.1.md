# Ascent 2.11.1

### Observe <a href="#observe" id="observe"></a>

**New Features & Improvements**

* Notification destinations can now only be viewed by authorized users, providing improved access control and clarity.
* When a resource is deleted, its associated entries are properly removed from permissions management, aiding data consistency.
* User sessions are now more reliably managed, and inactivity correctly results in logouts across all application pages for enhanced security.

**General Changes**

* Policy management navigation now works smoothly without breadcrumb issues.
* Further optimizations enhance dashboard load performance.

**Bug Fixes**

* Resolved an issue where newly added widgets appeared locked after saving a dashboard. Widgets are now functional and accessible upon dashboard creation.
* Users can now successfully upload and save scenarios in Scenario Management.

### Flow <a href="#flow" id="flow"></a>

**Bug Fixes**

* Searching in the alerts tab within the pipelines dashboard responds correctly, enabling more efficient issue tracking.
* Log extraction rules now function as intended, ensuring extracted values are visible and rules work consistently - not just during preview.

### Ascent Synthetics <a href="#ascent-synthetics" id="ascent-synthetics"></a>

**Bug Fixes**

* The Groups View and Manage Groups tab in Check Analytics now consistently show all monitor groups.
* Duplicate check names no longer appear in Manage Groups, ensuring a clear, accurate listing of checks.
* Check details opened from the operations view now display the correct location information, rather than “unknown.”
