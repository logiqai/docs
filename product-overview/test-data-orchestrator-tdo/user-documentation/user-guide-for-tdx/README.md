# User Guide for TDX

### About TDX

Test Data Extractor (TDX) is the Data Mining component of Test Data Orchestrator (TDO). TDO is the Self-Service Test Data Portal where you can simply specify your criteria and then acquire the data you need to support your testing requirements.

&#x20;It is like an ATM (automated teller machine) for Test Data.

&#x20;Your Criteria is generated as a ‘Coverage Matrix’ in TDO. TDX then reads this Coverage Matrix and extracts the exact data you need from source systems. TDO then assigns specific data automatically to each test and reserves it, saving you a lot of manual time and effort. It also auto populates data sheets for you, if required.

&#x20;Your Coverage Matrix in TDO can be generated from your Business Rules and other context, such as source data, scheme documentation etc. TDX then generates the SQL required to find the data which matches your criteria and automates the process of mining the data and bringing it back into TDO for Data Assignment. The selection and assignment of specific data to each test is also then automated for you. TDO will even generate data sheets in the format you need to support your Test Automation frameworks – or just CSVs for manual test execution.  &#x20;

&#x20;TDX eliminates manually searching for data that matches your tests.  TDX ensures that the data extracted exactly matches your test requirements based on the business rules entered in TDO that were used to generate your coverage matrix.

&#x20;Extracted data is automatically loaded into TDO into the project you specify as a new data block, ready for you to verify and use.
