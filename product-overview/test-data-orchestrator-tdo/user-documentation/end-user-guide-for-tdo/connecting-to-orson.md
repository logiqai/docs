### Logging into TDO

Begin by logging into TDO in Chrome or Chromium.

&#x20;

The URL for accessing TDO will look like one of these examples:

&#x20;

[http://35.214.52.73:8080/ui/public/login](http://35.214.52.73:8080/ui/public/login)  (using server IP address)

[https://35.214.52.73:443/ui/public/login](https://35.214.52.73/ui/public/login)  (with https enabled)

[http://localhost:8080/ui/public/login](http://localhost:8080/ui/public/login)   (using a remote desktop for using TDO)

[http://csc2cxn00004025.apica.com:8080/ui/public/login](http://csc2cxn00004025.apica.com:8080/ui/public/login) (where TDO is installed on a VM)

&#x20;

On the login screen, enter your user and password and click the LOGIN button.

### &#x20;Working With the Menu

&#x20;

You will see the initial splash screen.  The menu is accessed by clicking on the three stacked horizontal bars (‘burger menu’) in the upper left hand corner.

&#x20;

When you open the menu, you will see this.&#x20;

&#x20;

If you want to ‘pin’ the menu to the left side of your screen, click the pin icon at the top of the menu list.  If you do not ‘pin’ the menu, you will need to click the three bars each time you need to use the menu.

&#x20;

If you ‘pin’ the menu, the icon will change to a pin with a line through it.  Click this icon to unpin the menu.

### Selecting a Project

&#x20;

Click on ‘Projects’ under the Project section of the menu to open the Project screen.

&#x20;

&#x20;

The project screen will display all  the projects that you have authority to access.  Move your mouse to the right of the project names and the action buttons will open.  Click the blue check box to select the project you will be working in.  When you select a project, you will see a green message box with ‘Project has been successfully selected’ and the project name will be populated in the blue context box in the upper right corner.

&#x20;

If you don’t see the project name you believe you should have access to, please contact your administrator to request access.

&#x20;

&#x20;

You must select a project to work in before you can take any other actions.  TDO is context-driven, in that all of the actions you can perform are limited to the project, coverage set, and workset you have selected.
