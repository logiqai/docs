# Check Execution Service Update - April 29th 2024

On **Monday, April 29th**, we will roll out configuration changes to all SaaS public and dedicated locations to improve the consistency in check metrics across check runs within our NextGen (NG) check execution network. \
This might not be visible at all to many users but for some, who have checks that have pushed up against resource limitations, this have caused spikes of longer response times on some check transactions. This activity will address this issue.&#x20;

**This activity will cause no downtime or service disruption**.&#x20;

Thank you for your patience while we have worked out a solution for this.\
For any queries prior or throughout this activity, please reach out to [support@apica.io](mailto:support@apica.io)

Sincerely\
Joakim Baas\
Head of Customer Delivery
