# Apica Service Desk Transition - DONE

**Transition is set to begin at 11AM on May 15th, and is expected to be done at 12PM.**

Starting at 11AM, please refer to our new portal at [support.apica.io](http://support.apica.io)

IN PROGRESS At Apica, we always strive for continuous improvement and delighting our customers. In order to enhance our support capabilities and responsiveness, we will be transitioning our current Support function from Zendesk to Atlassian’s Jira Service Management (JSM) platform.

This transition will allow you to gain better insight into status of your open support tasks. In addition, the Apica support team will provide more clear status updates of any ongoing tasks and collaborate with our product team via design workflows that align to your needs as the customer.

## Why are we doing this transition? <a href="#apicaservicedesktransition-done-whyarewedoingthistransition" id="apicaservicedesktransition-done-whyarewedoingthistransition"></a>

* **Improve transparency between Apica Support & Customers**
  * _As we can design workflows and status of a ticket, you will get a better understanding of the current state of these requests._
* **Improve escalation response times**
  * _Some requests require escalation to our Product Engineering team or Technical Operations. By having the entire Apica organization on the same platform, we will be able to cut down escalation times._
* **Improve documentation**
  * _Utilizing Atlassian Confluence will allow us to reference support requests when creating/updating documentation with linked tickets (Apica internal process)._

## How will this affect you? <a href="#apicaservicedesktransition-done-howwillthisaffectyou" id="apicaservicedesktransition-done-howwillthisaffectyou"></a>

* **Customer portal**
  * _This will have very little effect on you. The main change will be a different link to submit customer support tickets. We will send links/invites to the “NEW” JSM portal closer to the final transition date._
* **Open tickets**
  * _No data will be lost!_
  * _Tickets will be recreated with the full history of the original ticket to stay on track._
  * _Apica Support will recreate tickets to minimize the impact on you._

## When will this occur? <a href="#apicaservicedesktransition-done-whenwillthisoccur" id="apicaservicedesktransition-done-whenwillthisoccur"></a>
