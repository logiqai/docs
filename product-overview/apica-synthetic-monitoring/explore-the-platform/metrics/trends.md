# Trends

The **Trends** view can be found at the bottom of the [Check Details](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2134213568/Understanding+Check+Details) and provides check run statistics.

## Analyzing Trends <a href="#trends-analyzingtrends" id="trends-analyzingtrends"></a>

The _Trends_ view allows you to compare trends over time for a number of metrics.

\
With trends, you get a view showing how the responses have been developing over time, as compared to a defined time period.

This allows you to detect developing variations in response times.

### Data Points <a href="#trends-datapoints" id="trends-datapoints"></a>

Pointing at a data point in the graph provides the check run date, name and response time.\


### Table <a href="#trends-table" id="trends-table"></a>

Data for previous runs are shown below the graph.
