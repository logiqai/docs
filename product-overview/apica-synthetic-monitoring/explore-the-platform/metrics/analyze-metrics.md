### Averages <a href="#analyzemetrics-averages" id="analyzemetrics-averages"></a>

For values that share a common unit, you can add lines indicate the average value for all metrics in the _Date Range_. A checkbox is available at the top of the chart, next to each value type:



Checking a box will display the average for that value type and unit in the chart:



### Shared Axis <a href="#analyzemetrics-sharedaxis" id="analyzemetrics-sharedaxis"></a>

If you have multiple metrics of different types that share the same unit, you can use a single Y-axis for display of their values. The default setting is to have multiple axes for different metrics:



The checkbox is available at the top of the chart:



Checking the box will combine Y-values for each unit type into one Y-axis for each type:



### Show Custom Events <a href="#analyzemetrics-showcustomevents" id="analyzemetrics-showcustomevents"></a>

If you have or expect to have Custom Events, you can display them in the timeline, below the metrics in the chart.

The checkbox is available at the top of the chart:



Checking the box will show any custom events occurring during the Date Range.



You can add custom events in Health & Events from the Custom Events view.

### Date Range <a href="#analyzemetrics-daterange" id="analyzemetrics-daterange"></a>

#### Date Range <a href="#analyzemetrics-daterange.1" id="analyzemetrics-daterange.1"></a>

The information in the graph is displayed for a specific date interval, which can be configured.

**View**

The configuration of displayed interval is available at the top of the chart:



This date range can also be stored as part of a saved Save View.

## Analyze Metrics <a href="#analyzemetrics-analyzemetrics" id="analyzemetrics-analyzemetrics"></a>

Analyze Metrics allows you to create a combined graph for metrics from multiple checks on the same timeline. Using the Analyze Metrics feature is a multistep process:

* You begin by picking up to 8 different metrics to display, by _Add Metrics_ from available checks.
  * You can set a _Custom Threshold_ to highlight any metrics that break that threshold.
  * Metric _Averages_ can be added to the graph to illustrate the variations in values over time.
  * Values that share the same unit of measure, can be displayed against a _Shared Axis_.
  * The graph can be printed or _Chart Menu_ as an image file.
* A particular combination of metrics can be saved as a _Save View_ for reuse which can be shared with other people, whether or not they have Synthetic Monitoring Accounts.
* The view can be used to create a _Analyze Metrics Subscription_ that is automatically sent via email to subscribers.

The following video provides a quick demonstration of the Analyze Metrics feature.

### Usage <a href="#analyzemetrics-usage" id="analyzemetrics-usage"></a>

The Analyze Metrics graph can be used in a lot of different ways to highlight information by combining information from multiple data sources.

### Share Information <a href="#analyzemetrics-shareinformation" id="analyzemetrics-shareinformation"></a>

The typical case to use Analyze Metrics is when you want to show metrics for a number of checks to people who don't have accounts in Synthetic monitoring. This could be customers relating to SLA agreements, Management or other teams for performance monitoring, or the general public for transparency. By using the Analyze Metric link, they get anonymous access to monitoring results.

**Example:** The performance of a server application is monitored by displaying the DOM Complete browser metrics for browser checks, using several checks to illustrate different areas of the application.

### Monitor Competition <a href="#analyzemetrics-monitorcompetition" id="analyzemetrics-monitorcompetition"></a>

With competition in your field, you may want to keep an eye on how your service or application performs compared to the competitor's offering. This can be achieved as long as they provide a publicly accessible interface, and you don't overload it with queries.

**Example:** The competitor's website is measured through a browser check with an attached scenario performing a number of tasks. Corresponding tasks are performed with a different browser scenario check on the in-company website. Metrics for both are displayed in an Analyze Metric graph.

### Multiple Locations <a href="#analyzemetrics-multiplelocations" id="analyzemetrics-multiplelocations"></a>

If you have your customers distributed geographically, you want to get a handle on how your performance is affected by where a customer accesses it from, compared to other locations.

**Example:** The same set of tasks are monitored by a browser check using multiple locations. The response time for the different locations is displayed in the Analyze Metrics graph, providing a quick visual overview of the differences in performance.

### Release Impact <a href="#analyzemetrics-releaseimpact" id="analyzemetrics-releaseimpact"></a>

When you make changes to your service or application, you will want to make sure that upgrades actually are improvements, and don't have any unforeseen negative effects.

**Example:** A number of different checks monitoring different aspects of the application are displayed together in the Analyze Metrics graph. Custom events are added to indicate release dates and system changes so that their impact is highlighted in the graph.

### Outage Review <a href="#analyzemetrics-outagereview" id="analyzemetrics-outagereview"></a>

When you are dependent on 3rd party services, it becomes important to determine how service outages or failover procedures impact your own application.

**Example:** Checks monitoring the 3rd party service directly are shown together with a set of standardized checks monitoring the application, providing insights into how the supporting service outages impact the main application.

## Analyze Metrics Subscription <a href="#analyzemetrics-analyzemetricssubscription" id="analyzemetrics-analyzemetricssubscription"></a>

By saving a _View_ as a **subscription**, you can have it automatically sent out at regular intervals to a number of recipients.



The view allows users to do some customizing while watching it, but these changes are permanently saved.

### Subscription Configuration <a href="#analyzemetrics-subscriptionconfiguration" id="analyzemetrics-subscriptionconfiguration"></a>

Subscriptions are always based on a particular _View_, but you can create the subscription right away when you create the view.

### Configuration <a href="#analyzemetrics-configuration" id="analyzemetrics-configuration"></a>

Subscriptions are always based on a particular _Save View_, but you can create the subscription right away when you create the view.

#### View <a href="#analyzemetrics-view.1" id="analyzemetrics-view.1"></a>

You can select existing views from the **View** dropdown menu.



Clicking the **Save & Share View** button will open the **Save View** dialog:
