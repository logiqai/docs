# Editing ZebraTester Checks

## Check Information <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-checkinformation" id="editingzebratesterchecks-checkinformation"></a>

### Scenario Class <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-scenarioclass" id="editingzebratesterchecks-scenarioclass"></a>

The core of any ASM ZebraTester check is the ZebraTester script. Scripts can either be uploaded and compiled or specified by class or zip name:



Scripts can be uploaded to ASM and compiled via the “Upload Scenario” functionality in ASM:



When you create a ZebraTester script on your own machine, the ZebraTester application is responsible for compiling the script into a runnable .class or .zip file. When you upload a ZT script to ASM, the compilation is done purely by a component on the ASM backend.

To begin adding a ZebraTester scenario, click the green “plus” sign to the right of the “Scenario Class” dropdown. The “Add Scenario” dialog appears:



## Advanced Options <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-advancedoptions" id="editingzebratesterchecks-advancedoptions"></a>

The Advanced Options governs the compilation behavior of the script:



### Compile with ZebraTester version <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-compilewithzebratesterversion" id="editingzebratesterchecks-compilewithzebratesterversion"></a>

During recompilation, older version scenarios will be converted to the selected version. Scenarios are backwards but not forwards compatible. That is, scenario files with a higher version can than the selected compiler can not be compiled with that compiler. The compiled scenario will only be executable on a [location](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2133688321/Understanding+ASM+Check+Host+Locations) that has a matching ZebraTester version installed.

#### Version Recommendations <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-versionrecommendations" id="editingzebratesterchecks-versionrecommendations"></a>

Where possible, you should select the highest possible version.

| Versions      | Compiler |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 4.6-Z → 5.5-F | 5.5-F    |
| 5.4-I → 5.5-A | 5.5-A    |
| 5.1-D → 5.4-D | 5.4-I    |
| 4.6-Z → 5.1-C | 5.1-C    |

## Advanced <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-advanced" id="editingzebratesterchecks-advanced"></a>



### Collect Ticks <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-collectticks" id="editingzebratesterchecks-collectticks"></a>

Check this box to collect extra data for each individual loop. The option is required if the test utilizes any looping; otherwise, no data about loops will be collected. When the box is ticked, there will be an option to click a link in the Check Result waterfall called “Ticks Details”:



When you click the “Ticks Details” link, you will be brought to a specific page:



There is a detailed URL history here. Users can see request and response headers for each past URL by clicking the “caret” dropdown to the right of the URL waterfall.

## Command Arguments <a href="#editingzebratesterchecks-commandarguments" id="editingzebratesterchecks-commandarguments"></a>

Within the “Command Arguments” section, it is possible to configure the ZebraTester check so that it functions as a small load test rather than a single loop, single user test.
