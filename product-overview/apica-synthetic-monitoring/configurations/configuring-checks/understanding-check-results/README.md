# Understanding Check Results

Knowing how to interpret your ASM check results is crucial to utilizing the platformâ€™s full potential. Check Result pages will appear different for different check types.

## Result Components Common to All Check Types <a href="#understandingcheckresults-resultcomponentscommontoallchecktypes" id="understandingcheckresults-resultcomponentscommontoallchecktypes"></a>

Some of the check result components are common to all check types; these common components will be reviewed in this article.

### Title Section <a href="#understandingcheckresults-titlesection" id="understandingcheckresults-titlesection"></a>

Every check result contains a Title Section which allows the user to see the most basic information related to their check and to access the Edit Check button:



Note that the sections above look essentially the same despite pertaining to two different check types. The only difference is the Check Description in the first screenshot; the second check does not have a description. Many of the elements present in the Title Section are self-explanatory (e.g. the inclusion of [Tags](broken-reference) and the number of Pages/URLs loaded in the check result).

The Test started and Test ended timestamps correlate to the configured timezone of the account.

The following icons contain links to various tools which can aid in result interpretation. Not every icon will appear for every check result.

### Access & Bookmarks <a href="#understandingcheckresults-access-and-bookmarks" id="understandingcheckresults-access-and-bookmarks"></a>

In most cases you can access the Details view by clicking a check wherever it is presented. Depending on the view you are in, the exact method to access the details varies. Whenever you access check Check Details, a bookmark is placed at the top of the window. The results bookmark shows the check url / name:



A similar bookmark is created for Result Details. The results bookmark shows the timestamp:



This allows you to keep a number of checks in the bookmarks bar and move between them by clicking the respective bookmark.

Clicking a bookmark will take you to the appropriate Check Details or Result Details detail view.
