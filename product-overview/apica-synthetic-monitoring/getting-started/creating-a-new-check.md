# Creating A New Check

Checks are the primary means of performing monitoring within ASM. To create a new check, click the “New Check +” button in the top ASM menu bar:

You will be brought to the “Create New Check” page:

From here, you can select the [type of check](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2132475994/Check+Types) you wish to set up. There is also a dedicated page for each individual check type under the main “Check Types” page.

Click on the icon corresponding to the check you wish to create to enter the New Check Wizard. Refer to this article’s subpages for more detailed instructions on creating individual check types.

Not every [check type](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2132475994/Check+Types) will be available by default. If you don’t see a check type which is listed in on the “[Check Types](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2132475994/Check+Types)” on the “Create New Check” page, contact your TAM or [Support](mailto:support@apica.io).

After the **New Check** wizard has been completed, the finished check is opened in [Edit mode](https://apica-kb.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASMDOCS/pages/2148991311/Editing+Checks).
